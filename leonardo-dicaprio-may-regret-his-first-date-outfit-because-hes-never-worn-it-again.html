Not really.”</p><p>He then opened up about wearing one on his first date. The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> actor explained: “I did wear one on my first date … I haven’t worn one since.” He then says that he got it from&nbsp;Mervyns.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-legend-of-the-turtleneck-on-leonardo-dicaprio-s-first-date>The legend of the turtleneck on Leonardo DiCaprio’s first date</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1205142326-683x1024.jpg><p>This isn’t the first time he’s spoken about the date or the turtleneck.</p><p>In a 1995 interview with Movieline Magazine, a 20-year-old Leo went into further detail about his date and clothes.</p><p>He said (<a href=# rel=nofollow>per</a> Cheatsheet): “I went out with this girl named Cessi, this littler Spanish beautiful girl. I was in the eighth grade. We had this beautiful relationship over the phone all summer, she was away, and we were so close and so bonded, and we’d tell each other everything. And then she came home, and we went out to the movies for the first time, and, oh God, I wanted it to be so perfect.</p><p>“So I put on my light blue turtleneck, which I thought was cool at the time. It was a turtleneck I bought from Kmart or something. When I saw Cessi, I was petrified and I couldn’t even look her in the eye or speak to her.”</p><p>It seems Leo has had more luck with dating in Hollywood since…</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-martin-scorsese-calls-leo-very-interesting>Martin Scorsese calls Leo “very interesting”</h2><p>Leo has worked with Martin Scorsese numerous times, including on Gangs of New York and The Wolf of Wall Street. It’s no wonder why <a href=#>when reading what the 81-year-old has said about him</a>.</p><p>The <a href=#>movie</a> director explained in an interview with Deadline: “What’s great about Leo, and it’s why we work together so often, is he goes there. He goes to these weird places that are so difficult and convoluted, and through the convolution, somehow there’s a clarity that we reach.”</p><p>“And usually it’s in the expression, in his face, in his eyes. I’ve always told him this. He’s a natural film actor. I could shoot a close-up of him, he could be thinking of nothing, and I could intercut anything with it, and people will say, ‘Oh, he’s reacting to such and such’. It’s the Kuleshov experiment. You could do that with him.”</p><p>The Kuleshov effect is when audiences can interpret more meaning from a sequence of shots rather than just a single one.</p><p>“There’s something in his face that the camera locks into, in his eyes. The slightest movement, we know it. Thelma [Schoonmaker], editing his footage with me over the years, often goes, ‘Look at this. Look at the eye movement here. I think we should keep it.’ It’s very interesting what goes on behind the eyes. It’s all there.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2d%2BcLjEqKWaqpSkeqW1wpqnq6GfYrqixYyrnKCqlal6qbXSZp2iqqOpeqWt055kqK2km7a1ecGempqto5p6qbHSZqWerpWneri70adkoqxdlrSitc1o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amazon-prime-video-issues-and-how-to-fix-them.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>8 Annoying Amazon Prime Video Issues (and How to Fix Them)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lash-extensions-before-and-after.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lash Extensions Before and After</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
