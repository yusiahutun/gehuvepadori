This means an eye lift is now possible without surgery. We spoke to Dr. Sophie Shotter, one of the UK’s most renowned aesthetic practitioners. She is a multi award-winning aesthetic doctor, with over a decade of medical experience and is regularly featured in the media as an expert voice in all things health and aesthetics. "My motto is that every face is a unique piece of artwork. My aim is to bring out the best in each individual patient, not to change them."&nbsp;explains Dr. Sophie.</p><p id=eOaNhvugK7Aj data-wc=16><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<span>Fans are raving about this eye lift serum that takes '10 years off’ your appearance</span></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/58633e97ece1-eyes-injection-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eQTVznqBPxxj data-wc=8><strong>Injectibles can be a safe alternative to surgery</strong></p><h2><span style=background-color:initial>How can you get a non-surgical eyelift?&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=eCUJF3-3UB6J data-wc=99><span style=background-color:initial>Dr Sophie has introduced the '360 Eye'&nbsp;treatment, which combines the new Sofwave technology with other eye rejuvenation techniques in order to ensure clients can have the effects of an eye lift without even going near a scalpel. Sofwave teamed with Light Eyes Ultra, a mesotherapy cocktail for under the eyes that targets sagging, superficial lines and dark circles. It contains a unique blend of hyaluronic acid, ruscosides and antioxidants including vitamin C and is superficially injected into the area using a fine needle. Then the process is finished with Botox and Filler for an added tear trough boost.</span></p><p id=enA6ChpIGos1 data-wc=16><span style=background-color:initial>We found out more about the non-surgical procedure from Dr Sophie, who answered all our questions...</span></p><p id=eNK2WLhYD1Oy data-wc=10><strong><span style=background-color:initial>Who/what kind of patients do you recommend '360 Eye' for?</span></strong></p><p id=e_DfS9pKaNwQ data-wc=63><span style=background-color:initial>"The 360 Eye is excellent for any patients with tired looking eyes. It provides an all-around approach to the different components of eye ageing - heavy eyelids, dark circles, hollowness and fine lines and wrinkles. We can combine all of the steps as needed for an individual patient to brighten the eye area and give the face a more rested and rejuvenated look."</span></p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eFUD6MP5hng2 data-wc=5><strong><span style=background-color:initial>What happens during each treatment?</span></strong></p><p id=ebeL_UBeZjCf data-wc=76><span style=background-color:initial>"1) Sofwave - a powerful numbing cream is applied to the eye and brow area. When ready for treatment we apply a jelly to the skin to help the ultrasound waves to transmit into the skin. We position the applicator as needed around the eye area, and deliver a burst of ultrasound energy. You may feel some mild heat in some of the areas around the eye. You’re a little red afterwards but this resolves quickly.</span></p><p id=eU8QJ-h4SX_n data-wc=53><span style=background-color:initial>2) Light Eyes - we apply numbing cream to the eye area, and once removed use a very fine needle to inject this mesotherapy solution into the skin around the eye. The treatment is repeated at fortnightly intervals, and leaves the undereye skin looking brighter, less puffy and with less visible dark circles.</span></p><p id=eTmz4JO9tf0e data-wc=46><span style=background-color:initial>3) Fillers - we use fillers in the cheeks and temples as needed first, to provide a structural framework for the eye area. We then inject the tear trough itself if appropriate. This is done with very small needles or cannula to position the filler precisely.</span></p><p id=eld1h1NZ8PAR data-wc=111><span style=background-color:initial>4) Wrinkle relaxing injections - we focus on lifting the eye area by treating around the eye area and the frown with very fine needles. Fine lines and wrinkles will also be softened. The results are different from a surgical eyelift. But many patients are reluctant to undergo surgery - they are either afraid or don’t have the ability to tolerate downtime. These procedures have minimal to no downtime and address the global signs of eye ageing. If someone has very heavy upper eyelids or severe undereye bags, then no treatment is as effective as blepharoplasty. However most patients are along a spectrum and can have great results from &nbsp;360 Eye."</span></p><p id=eJMOAjV-CqOM data-wc=8><strong><span style=background-color:initial>What have your clients said about the procedure?</span></strong></p><p id=e5z7nBaTVjNh data-wc=66><span style=background-color:initial>"Our patients have been delighted. When we read a face, we look at someone’s eyes and then their mouth - they’re the first thing we focus on. As such we want them to look bright and reflect how we are feeling. Patients have been over the moon and feel that an area that’s been their biggest problem has once again become the highlight of their face."</span></p><p id=eAR80uX-ao3k data-wc=8></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue5FpaWtoZmZ9coCRbm1uZ56ku7TB0aCgnJmcYrK6scuina1lo6SztcPAr5xmnKJiwLC8x6KcZquYpMG1sdFo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./541664-how-read-shatter-series-order-series-complete.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to read Shatter Me series in order: Is the series complete?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-cold-call-refund-scams-work.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Cold Call Refund Scams Work</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
