Isn’t that par for the course of a comedian? … Whether we want to admit to it or not, it is the DNA of those in the chosen profession of comedy to say stuff that no one could get away with if they weren’t on a stage. Go listen to some of your favorite comedians and tell me if they said racist, sexist, homophobic stuff about any group.

I’m from Chicago. I grew up hearing lots of n-word jokes. I still hear them when I’m back home. And people laughed, and they still laugh. That doesn’t change the fact that the jokes were and are racist, and I speak up when people tell them. Outside of the Ku Klux Klan, we don’t justify hate based on DNA. And homophobia and racism aren’t acceptable simply because some people find them funny.<br></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-9a7e4b7077b27da7298255e7231c8c4b-11-0-0@published data-word-count=15>Comedian Wanda Sykes, a married lesbian with twins, <a href=#>tweeted</a> her responses to Morgan and Martin:</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-9a7e4b7077b27da7298255e7231c8c4b-12-1-0@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-9a7e4b7077b27da7298255e7231c8c4b-13-0-0@published data-word-count=44>I fault the TN lawmakers.

And Tracy cannot understand the pain of a gay child raised in homophobic America, under the constant barrage of taunts, threats of violence, and the ever-present fear of being exposed and rejected. Neither of us reached adulthood unscathed by the shared prejudices of our culture. We’ve arrived at manhood slightly distorted, wounded and limited by our battles.
