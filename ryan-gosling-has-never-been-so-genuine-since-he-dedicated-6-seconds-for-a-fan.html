But he knows when to step up when it comes to his fans and being a decent human being. So when it came to the guy behind the Ryan Gosling cereal meme passing away, he took it on himself to give the perfect and most genuine tribute.</strong></p><p>The mastermind behind the <a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a> cereal meme, Ryan McHenry managed to gain fame for the perfect, yet simple, concept. For two years, Ryan would upload videos holding a spoon full of cereal up to the <a href=#>TV</a> screen. While playing the <a href=#>celebrity</a>‘s movies on the screen, he pretended Ryan Gosling’s facial expressions were as if he’s refusing to eat the crunchy cereal. The short clips, mostly on Vine, which now doesn’t exist, were popular.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meme-creator-died-of-cancer>Meme creator died of cancer</h2><p>Murphy, from Edinburgh in the UK, died in April 2015, two years after introducing Ryan Gosling’s hilarious reaction to cereal on the social media platform. Now, users tend to go on <a href=#>TikTok</a> or Instagram for the same effect.</p><p>The 27-year-old’s clips would often go viral, prompting movie fans to beg the actor to in fact eat or not eat cereal on screen himself. Murphy would call the videos ‘Ryan Gosling Won’t Eat His Cereal’ and managed to find an impressive amount of clips to use in the background. They first gained popularity in 2013 and McHenry even bagged a social media award.</p><p>He gained more than 200,000 followers on the app.</p><p>Sadly, the Edinburgh College of Art graduate suffered from osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer. He was diagnosed with more than a dozen tumors on his lung. McHenry also shared his brave battle on social media at the time.</p><p>He would try other <a href=#>Hollywood</a> stars out too, like Leo DiCaprio falling over a bowl of cereal.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ryan-gosling-ate-his-cereal-for-a-good-cause>Ryan Gosling ate his cereal – for a good cause</h2><p>The star, who is with long-time partner Eva Mendes – posted a sweet tribute to McHenry a week after his death.</p><p>The Canada native turned on the camera, sat down with a bowl in front of him, raised the spoon as a toast and tucked into the breakfast staple. He posted the clip on Vine for McHenry’s followers and family, and also paid tribute on <a href=#>Twitter</a>.</p><p>He penned at the time: “My heart goes out to all of Ryan McHenry’s family and friends.</p><p>“Feel very lucky to have been a part of his life in some small way.”</p><p>A friend of McHenry, Naysun Alae-Carew, was happy with what the star managed to do.</p><p>They said: “It’s the most fitting send-off any of his friends or family could have hoped for. It was something he had always talked about.</p><p>“A few weeks ago, Ryan Gosling acknowledged the vines for the first time, and Ryan McHenry was really happy about it.</p><p>“To have this is just amazing and for us and particularly his family it just really validates how much Ryan gave.&nbsp;</p><p>“They are just vines to make people laugh but to have Ryan Gosling respond just shows the effect that Ryan McHenry had on the world.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2Z%2FcL7YmqVmn5%2Bouaq6xmafmqtdo7K3sdFmmZ6dnmLAsHnGnqWuoZ6aerS1zZycZqCVYrGmsMicmK2dlGKDbr%2FEnKannKNis7C%2BjJpkn5meZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-bachelor-who-sonia-sharma-real-job-instagram-age-zach-shallcrosss-cast-member-in-2023-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Sonia Sharma?
