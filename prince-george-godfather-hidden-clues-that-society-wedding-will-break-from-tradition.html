He's a lucky boy to be given all the material things in life, but he'll need to be robust mentally to survive.

However, he hit the headlines following his lavish 21st birthday celebrations, which attracted an impressive 800 invitees including Prince Harry and Michael McIntyre. It may have been over a decade ago, but it could be an indication that his wedding will be an equally grand affair.</p><p id=e45Phx3olZ data-wc=12><strong>DON'T MISS:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Meghan Markle's inconsistencies with secret Prince Harry first date explained</a></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
