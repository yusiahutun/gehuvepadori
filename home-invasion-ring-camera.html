In the video, three men are seen in front of the victim's home, with two of them pushing inside the house when he opens the door. The third man -- who has yet to be identified by authorities -- can be seen taking a gun from his pants while waiting outside.</p><p>Shortly after, the other two run back out of the house and all three book it to a car waiting in the driveway as gunshots can be heard.</p><p>Per police, "during this home invasion, the victim's pistol fell to the ground and was picked up by one of the invaders. The victim ran to the back room of the house where he had another firearm and began firing at his intruders."</p><p>According to authorities, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a>, the home owner's second gun was an "AK-47-style rifle."</p><p>"The three ran franticly from the home to their vehicle where the fourth suspect, Joseph Sanders, was waiting and drove off, hitting a nearby mailbox," added police in a statement.</p><p>"He did absolutely nothing wrong," Escambia County Sheriff Chip Simmons told "Fox & Friends First" on Thursday.
