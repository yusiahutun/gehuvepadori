But how do you know which is best for you? What exactly is the difference between babylights vs. highlights, anyway? “The two terms are very similar,” says Atlanta-based colorist, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Rachel Korman</a> of<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow> Tinte Salon</a>. To learn more, we tapped Korman and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>James Corbett</a>, colorist and founder of<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5> James Corbett Studio</a>, who let us in on everything there is to know about the two popular coloring techniques, including when to use each.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-highlights></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are Highlights?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Highlighting is a treatment that lightens hair to mimic what the sun would do in order to draw attention to certain pieces of hair,” says Korman.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Highlights are always lighter than your base color, and the lightening process is achieved by using an ammonia-based product that draws pigment out of the hair. Decades ago, highlights were applied by first placing a plastic cap with tiny holes spaced evenly across it on the client’s head and then using a metal tool to pull tiny sections of hair through the cap. Now, there is a greater art to the application, with colorists choosing the spacing and which sections to lighten by ‘weaving’ strips of hair to separate them from the rest of the hair and laying those strips on foils before then applying the lightening agent to lift the hair color.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Highlights can be applied in different ways, and colorists categorize highlights with various terms including full highlights, partial highlights, dimensional highlights, babylights, and teezy lights. A full highlight means lightening hair all over the head, while a partial means just doing the front or top portion of the hair while leaving the back alone. Both the application process and someone’s individual preference dictates how long highlights ‘last’ between appointments. Do you want bright color with no roots, or are you ok with a more ‘lived in ‘ look?</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-babylights></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are Babylights?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Babylights are an application style within the method of highlighting,” Korman tells us. They're super-fine highlights that offer the most natural brightening effect to the hair. “Babylights are a more modern way of highlighting hair, and the rule for applying them is that it’s such a thin section of hair that you can read the newspaper through it,” says Korman.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According toCorbett, the term came into fashion around 2008 as trends began shifting away from the heavy, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>chunky highlights</a> of the ‘90s and early aughts. “Babylights give you a subtle melt of light hair that creates an all-over brightness,” he says. Thus, babylights offer lightened hair color without ‘stripes’ or obvious sections of lighter pieces.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Babylights are applied with foils, the same way that highlights are applied, just with smaller pieces of hair in each section being lightened. They are also often focused around the hairline, natural part, and even toward the ends of the hair to achieve a natural final look.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-benefits-of-highlights></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Benefits of Highlights</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Highlights are used to create dimension and movement to any hair color. They offer a pronounced contrast between darker (often your natural hair color) and lighter hair, and are often a very noticeable change.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When I’m looking for something more prominent and want the section to stand out, I highlight,” says Corbett. “Highlights can add drama and interest by accentuating the layers of your haircut.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When applied to curly hair, highlights can make specific curls pop, and highlights are also strategically placed in the hair to accentuate certain facial features, i.e. make your cheekbones pop. Highlights are also used to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cover up gray hair</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-benefits-of-babylights></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Benefits of Babylights</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Babylights are used to fully brighten up the hair without having to bleach it to a solid blonde all over. By leaving some of the base hair color in between the lightened strands you achieve a more natural color as there is more dimension, and it also offers an easier regrowth process as you don’t have a solid line of ‘outgrowth’ from the root. That dimension also helps add depth and even the illusion of thickness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Babylights can give fine hair the appearance of looking thicker due to the dimension it creates,” says Corbett. Korman reiterates that basically all highlights applied on fine hair are, in fact, babylights.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-choose-between-highlights-vs-babylights></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Choose Between Highlights vs. Babylights</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you want to recreate the look of a child’s hair lightening up in the summer because of all the time they spend in the sun, you’re probably in the market for babylights. The same goes for people who prefer a more <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>low-maintenance hair color</a>. If you like to squeeze more time in between your hair color appointments, babylights are also likely the right choice as the regrowth isn’t as dramatic since the sections of hair are smaller.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you are looking for a more dramatic look, you’re probably after highlights. “I was taught the phrase, ‘Do you want to whisper, talk, or shout?’” reflects Corbett on determining what people want from their hair color. Babylights definitely don’t shout, and highlights could never whisper.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-maintain-highlights-and-babylights></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Maintain Highlights and Babylights</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since babylights involve tinier sections of hair being lightened, it’s not as notable as they grow out, which means, yes, by default, babylights are less maintenance than thicker highlights. However, any lightened hair requires the same type of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>at-home care</a> to properly maintain its health and integrity. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Hair that has been bleached</a> should be treated gently, as bleach makes hair more fragile and brittle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Don’t wash your hair daily, and when you do, use shampoo and conditioner intended for color-treated hair like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Biolage Color Last Shampoo</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Conditioner</a>. Purple shampoo like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Kristin Ess The One Purple Shampoo</a> is a great option for toning any brassiness out of blonde hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It’s also important to use a hair masque or deep conditioner at least once a week, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Olaplex No.8 Bond Intense Moisture Mask</a> gives you professional-level hydration at home. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Shaz & Kiks Nourishing Naram Conditioner</a> is a deeply hydrating everyday conditioner for when your hair is feeling dry.

Sleeping on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>silk pillowcases</a> and running a humidifier when you sleep in colder months are also excellent ways to take care of color-treated hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“You have to take care of your investment if you want it to look good,” says Corbett. “If you buy an expensive cashmere sweater, would you throw it in the washing machine with dish soap?”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faqs-5481ba76-1096-43c0-acd6-1eff343f3d4c></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=46.896896896897><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Where should your colorist incorporate babylights vs. highlights?</span></p><p>Babylights are regularly used in the front of the hair in conjunction with ‘standard’ highlights for the most natural final product. “Hair should be really blended around the face, so I always typically apply a babylight when I’m framing someone’s face, whereas I place highlights in the back of the head,” Korman says.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=2 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Are babylights or highlights more expensive?</span></p><p>Prices will vary depending on your location and colorist, but babylights will generally cost more than highlights because they are more labor-intensive for the colorist.
