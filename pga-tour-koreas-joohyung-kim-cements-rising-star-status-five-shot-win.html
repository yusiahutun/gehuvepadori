Last Sunday, he secured enough FedEx Cup points as a to earn his Tour card for the 2022-23 season.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Mickelson among 11 players to sue PGA Tour over LIV suspensions</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s crazy,” Kim said. “I mean, I’ve never won a golf tournament starting with a quad and here we are. I played great this week. It was hard to stay in the moment in the final round just knowing that I was so close, but I never let my guard down until I holed that putt on 18.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kim returned early on Sunday to complete the remaining eight holes of the weather-disrupted third round with a 68 and trailed third-round leader, Im by two. Nicknamed Tom after Thomas the Tank Engine, Kim charged out like a bullet train in the final round, shooting six birdies and an eagle for an outward 27 to take full control of the tournament which was the final event of the regular season.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Victory also moves Kim to No. 21 in the world rankings and has put himself in position for a spot on the International Team for the Presidents Cup against the US at Quail Hollow next month.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s been a hectic month and a lot of things have changed, for sure,” Kim said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’ve expected so much of myself and so does my team, we expect the highest. And it hasn’t been the easiest. It might look easy for a lot of people, but it’s a lot of work behind the scenes just from the manager doing so much beyond for me and my family who put in sacrifices.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is just a start for me and I still have so much I want to accomplish and this is just – I bought the car, we bought the car, we just need to drive it, so hopefully I keep pushing that pedal.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kim said securing his Tour card last week in Detroit had given him the freedom to freewheel his game at the Wyndham Championship, where he became the third Korean winner of the event following K.J. Choi in 2005 and Si Woo Kim in 2016. He is also the ninth Korean to win on Tour.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I told myself just have fun, enjoy it, you’ve got your card already, just enjoy every single moment and don’t get too intense,” Kim said. “But this back nine was crazy, it was probably the most intense round I’ve played. My putter felt like 200 pounds today, I’m not going to lie, it was crazy.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sungjae Im and John Huh finished in a tie for second, and while Im was disappointed to fall short, the result second earned him a place in the Tour top 10 and a US$1 million bonus pay out. He also took his hat off to Kim, who he had played a practice round with at the start of the week.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I missed a few clutch putts on the front nine which got me to a bad start, but overall I’m happy with the tie for second finish,” Im said. “I’m really, really happy for Tom. He’s a great kid and to come out here and to win on Tour as a non-member and secure your card is really not an easy task and he achieved that. I’m really proud of him.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1moKecm3yivtOimqWdX2h%2BeYSPcGhoqJeWerW71KtkpKeimq60ecmopqGxpaO0brfIpmScnZ2au7W%2FjKugrKGenHq0wMCrZKyskanCtHnFoq2eZaOdvLV51qKl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lego-black-friday-deals.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Star Wars, Harry Potter, Jurassic Park</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./onlyfans-model-crypto-bro-boyfriend-star-cringeworthy-valentines-day-campaign-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>OnlyFans model and her 'crypto bro' boyfriend star in 'cringeworthy' Valentine's Day campaign</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
