Steve is also a former Marine Corps and Chicago police officer.</strong></h3><h2>Rosae Wilkos - The First Wife of Steve Wilkos</h2><p><strong>Rosae Wilkos </strong>is best known for being the former wife of the popular celebrity, host, and retired US Marine and Chicago police officer, <strong>Steve Wilkos</strong>. Rosae Wilkos and her ex-partner <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Steve Wilkos</strong></a> walked down the aisle on 21 August 1985.</p><p>However, the exclusive details regarding their wedding ceremony are still in the dark. However, their matrimonial life didn't last long as the duo decided to get a divorce only after two years of living together as husband and wife. Likewise, the reason for divorce is still unclear. They never shared any children.&nbsp;</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2021/05/12/rosae-wilkos-with-her-husband-steve-wilkos--1620839842.jpg width=450 height=430 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Rosae Wilkos's ex-husband Steve Wilkos poses for a photograph. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Pinterest</span></strong><p>Speaking about Steve's ex-wife's current whereabouts and relatinship, it is in the dark. In addition, Rosae is inactive on every social media platform and doesn't prefer to come into the limelight. Thus, that's also the reason why it is very hard to learn more about what's happening in her personal as well as professional life.&nbsp;</p><h2>Current Married Life of Rosae Wilkos's Ex-Husband Steve Wilkos</h2><p>The former spouse of Rosae Wilkos married three times in his life. Rosae was his first wife while Wilkos's last marriage was with <strong>Rachelle Wilkos </strong>who is his current wife. Steve Wilkos's spouse is an executive producer of&nbsp;the Steve Wilkos show.</p><p>Wilkos and Rachelle exchanged the wedding vows on July 7, 2000, and were blessed with a son named <strong>Jack Wilkos</strong> and a daughter named <strong>Ruby Wilkos</strong>. Jack was born in 2005 and is two years younger than her sister Ruby who was born in 2003.</p><p>Before his marriage with Rachelle, Steve previously married another woman named <strong>Hannah Wilkos</strong> whose information is not disclosed yet. Rosae's ex-husband's second marriage proved to be as fleeting as his first with her, and surprisingly, it ended in divorce the same year that Rosae and Steve tied the knot.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2021/05/12/rosae-wilkson-s-ex-husband-with-his-wife-rachelle-wilkson-and-children--1620836260.jpg width=450 height=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Rosae Wilkson's ex-husband Steve Wilkos with his wife Rachelle Wilkson and their two children.&nbsp;</span><span class=imageSource> SOURCE: Steve Wilkson Instagram</span></strong><p>Despite having two previous heart-wrenching splits in the past, Steve holds himself up and now, relishes a delightful relationship with his present partner, Rachelle. The family of four resides in a beautiful house in Connecticut and is often seen hanging out together, attending shows and events, and celebrating festivals and birthdays.</p><p>Watch the videos of Rosae Wilkos's former spouse Steve Wilkos playing a fun game with his wife Rachelle Consigilo on his show The Wilkos Show below.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the bond between Steve Wilkos and Rachelle Wilkson seems to be inseparable as there has never been a single rumor of the husband and wife getting divorced. We hope Steve Wilkos will stay together with his third wife Rachelle as a lovey-dovey couple forever and that his third marriage doesn't end up like his previous ones.</p><p>In 2020, Steve's wife Rachelle was reported to be treated for breast cancer following her diagnosis. She had a double mastectomy at Stamford Hospital and needed chemotherapy and medication at the end of the year, the cancer prognosis improved and in March 2021, Mrs. Wilkos was free from cancer and is now in good health.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Net Worth of Steve Wilkos's Ex-Wife</h2><p>The inactivity of Rosae Wilkos on social media platforms has made it difficult for the global audience to learn how much is her net worth or salary. However, from the fact that Rosae was once the wife of millionaire Steve Wilkson, her life shouldn't have been a troubled one financially.</p><p>Talking about the net worth of her ex-husband, Steve's <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth stands at</a> <strong>$6 million</strong>. The main source of income for such a whopping net worth and assets came from his profession as a talk show host. Not to mention, he is also a former retired Marine and Chicago Police officer.&nbsp;</p><h2>Quick Facts of Rosae Wilkos</h2><ul><li>As for her religion, Rose is a Catholic.</li><li>Rosae's ex-husband resides in Darien, Connecticut together with his wife Rachelle and two kids.</li><li>The meaning of the name of Rosae in Latino simply means rose.</li></ul><p>see more celebrity-related content only on <a href=# rel=noopener>Married Wiki</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDsKCkoV6YvK571qKiomeipMCisYywoKWjn6g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./10-proven-ways-to-anger-management.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 Proven Ways for Anger Management</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cat-person-movie-clip-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cousin Greg?
