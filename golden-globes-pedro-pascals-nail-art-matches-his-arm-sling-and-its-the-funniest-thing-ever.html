Despite his injuries, Pedro being Pedro, he found a perfect opportunity for some creative nail art, and fans are in stitches.</strong></p><p>The TV and <a href=#>movie</a> star was first spotted sporting the sling on January 2, when photos of the 48-year-old at a New Year’s celebration were posted by actress&nbsp;Jaime Ray Newman. Now, he’s opened up about what happened to cause the injury at the 2024 <a href=#>Golden Globes</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1915880677-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-pedro-pascal-explains-arm-sling-at-golden-globes>Pedro Pascal explains arm sling at Golden Globes</h2><p>The 48-year-old was nominated for best actor in a drama <a href=#>TV</a> series for his role as Joel in HBO’s&nbsp;The Last of Us, but it seemed like his arm accessory was getting more attention.</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> wore the black sling amongst his all-black ensemble on Sunday night, but he definitely wasn’t hiding it from fans and reporters.</p><p>Answering the question on everyone’s mind, the star said the injury was simply caused by a fall, which could “happen to any of us.”</p><p>Aside from the sling, the heartthrob looked dapper in a unique black turtleneck, jazzed up with white bows at the <a href=#>award show</a>. Of course, he wore his iconic glasses, and kept the look simple on the bottom half, with black smart trousers.</p><p>What many may not have seen, however, is the star’s nail art, which read the letters “O-U-C-H” on each nail. Very fitting.</p><p>Of course, fans had to take to social media to comment on the hilarious design, as one tweeted: “Pedro Pascal, his poor wing and his funny nail tattoo LMAO I LOVE HIM SO MUCH.”</p><p>“Pedro Pascal’s nails spelling “ouch” at the Golden Globes is the funniest/cutest s*** ever,” wrote another.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-star-turns-into-a-meme>The star turns into a ‘meme’</h2><p>Everybody loves Pedro, and it looks like X, formerly known as <a href=#>Twitter</a>, loves him even more after last night as he turned into the iconic ‘laughing then crying’ meme.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Narcos star didn’t win a Globe this time, and his category was won by Kieran Culkin for Succession, who jokingly roasted the actor in his speech as he exclaimed: “Suck it, Pedro!”</p><p>However, all jokes aside, the 48-year-old was praised online for his humble reaction to Kieran’s win, as the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star cheered and gave him a standing ovation.</p><p>“PEDRO PASCAL YOU ARE THE BEST PERSON I’VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE,” exclaimed one fan upon seeing the wholesome reaction.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2WFcLPOpZuepl2cubCuxKxkqZ2Up7xuvMCsmpqko2K7orXLZpirrF2irrWvx56qZqCZqHqivsxmqqWhnpx6orrDZqCtq12ptaZ5xa6lp6GVqMFuwMeipaBllauys3s%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./married-sight-stars-jules-robinson-cameron-merchant-expecting-second-child-never-lost-faith-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Married At First Sight stars Jules Robinson and Cameron Merchant are expecting their second child: '</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./celebrity-birthdays-13-may-stevie-wonder-robert-pattinson.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Celebrity birthdays 13 May: Stevie Wonder and Robert Pattinson</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
