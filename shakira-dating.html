After a highly publicized divorce from Gerard Piqué, many people wonder who<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>&nbsp;Shakira is dating now.</a></p><p>The Colombian singer’s relationships have been put under the microscope after a turbulent year. It was revealed that Gerard Piqué cheated on her amid their 2022 divorce. What better way to deal with the pain than with a hit song? Shakira released an incredibly<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>&nbsp;viral song collaboration</a>&nbsp;with Bizzarap where she&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>directly disses her ex</a>&nbsp;and his new lover. “I’m worth two 22-year-olds, you traded a Ferrari for a Twingo; you traded a Rolex for a Casio,” she sings in a<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>&nbsp;translation via Billboard.</a>&nbsp;“I understood that it’s not my fault that they criticize you; I only make music, sorry that it splashed you. You left me, my mother-in-law as my neighbor, media outlets at my door and in debt with the government.”</p><p>At&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billboard’s Latin Women In Music Awards</a>&nbsp;in May 2023, Shakira made a touching speech that some think is directed towards her ex-husband. “This has been a year of seismic change in my life where I’ve felt more than ever — and very personally — what it is to be a woman,” Shakira declared. “It’s been a year where I’ve realized we women are stronger than we think, braver than we believed, more independent than we were taught to be.</p><p>The singer continued, “Because what woman hasn’t at some time in her life forgotten herself because she’s seeking the attention and love of someone else? It happened to me, more than once,” she added. “But there comes a time in the life of every woman where she no longer depends on someone else to love and accept herself just as she is. A time when the search for someone else is replaced by the search for oneself. A time when the desire to be perfect is replaced by the desire to be authentic, and where finding someone who is faithful is less important than being faithful to ourselves.”</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.9486652977413><h2>Lucien Laviscount&nbsp;(2024 - present)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/lucien-laviscount.jpg><p>A source confirmed to <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13264673/shakira-dating-lucien-laviscount-romance-punteria-music-video.html rel=nofollow>Daily Mail </a>that Shakira is dating British actor Lucien Laviscount. They reportedly fell in love on the set of her music video for “Punteria. “Shakira is desperate to fall in love – but her friends are concerned because Lucien has slowly crept his way up the celebrity ladder while dating women who were all less famous than Shakira,” a source told the gossip site.</p><p>A source divulged that not all her friends approve of her new beau. “Her friends fear he just wants people to know his name and she provides that,” they said of the Emily In Paris actor. “They are seeing each other but are not heavily involved yet.”</p><p>They claimed that she is “not over her ex” Gerard Piqué and that everyone around her ‘knows that Lucien is a rebound.’ They concluded, “She is dating someone who they fear is a player and she is going to get burned.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8.2924720244151><h2>Lewis Hamilton (2023)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/lewis-hamilton.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>People</a>, Shakira is being “fun and flirty” with F1 racer and champion Lewis Hamilton.&nbsp;</p><p>A source told the site, “They’re spending time together and in the ‘getting to know you’ stage. It’s fun and flirty.”</p><p>The two went out to dinner after the &nbsp;F1 Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona, Spain. Among those who joined include Daniel Caesar, Fai Khadra and Mustafa. Mustafa posted the outing in his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram story.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Shakira and Lewis were also seen after the F1 Miami Grand Prix hanging out on a boat. Around this time, Shakira was embroiled with dating rumors with Tom Cruise, which were later disproved as sources told Heat Magazine that it was pretty one sided. “He came away convinced they had a real connection they needed to build on,” the source said. “She doesn’t want to embarrass or upset him, but there’s no attraction or romance on her part — she was just being friendly. She’s flattered but not interested..”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.9066022544283><h2>Gerard Pique (2010 - 2022)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Gerard-Pique-Shakira.jpg><p>Shakira met Gerard on the set of her&nbsp;music video&nbsp;for the FIFA anthem “Waka Waka (This Time for Africa).” The two announced that they were together in 2011 in a Facebook post. On June 4, 2022, Shakira and Gerard announced&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>their split</a>&nbsp;in a joint statement. They wrote, “We regret to confirm that we are separating. For the well-being of our children, who are our highest priority, we ask that you respect our privacy. Thank you for your understanding.” The Barcelona-based soccer player has been with Clara “for the past few months,”&nbsp;The Sun reported. An insider revealed that “She is a student who also works for him in his office, organizing events. They have been keeping quiet about their relationship but those around them all know what is happening.”<br>&nbsp;<br>A source told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Hollywood Life</a>&nbsp;that the Colombian singer is&nbsp;trying her best&nbsp;to keep her composure when there was an abundance of evidence of Gerard and his new girlfriend Clara Chia Marti’s new relationship is coming out. The source said, “Shakira&nbsp;feels like she has done everything in her power to maintain an amicable co-parenting relationship with Gerard including not collecting on child support or anything. Even though Gerard is still living in Barcelona she has even agreed to cover the costs for him to visit his children in Miami on a regular basis. So, for him to put something like this out there feels so unnecessary.&nbsp;Of course, nobody wants to see their ex make out with somebody else but she moved on long before they called things off. Her kids are her first priority and even though they had a pact to not go public for a year after their break-up, she can’t control what he does and she&nbsp;knows it&nbsp;was bound to happen at some point.”<br>&nbsp;<br>In an&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Elle</a>&nbsp;interview, she talked about how the media’s perception of the breakup affected her kids, Milan, 9 and Sasha, 7. “What’s also real is the disappointment to see something as sacred and as special as I thought was the relationship I had with my kids’ father and see that turned into something vulgarized and cheapened by the media. And all of this while my dad has been in the ICU and I’ve been fighting on different fronts. Like I said, this is probably the darkest hour of my life. But then I think about all those women around the world who are going through hardship, who are going through a situation as bad as mine or as difficult as mine or worse.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.5><h2>Antonio de la Rua (2000 - 2010)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Antonio-De-La-Rua.jpg><p>Shakira was in a ten-year-long relationship with son of the former President of Argentina Antonio de la Ra from 2000 to 2010.&nbsp;</p><p>Shakira wrote on her website why they broke up. “Since August 2010, we made a mutual decision to take time apart from our romantic relationship. Throughout this time we have continued to work together hand in hand, have remained close and have kept the details absolutely private until now. We view this period of separation as temporary and as a time of individual growth as we continue to be partners in our business and professional lives.”</p><p>She continued, “Antonio continues to oversee and conduct my business and career interests as he has always done. We move forward as partners, developing projects together, working hand in hand and in close communication. Our friendship and understanding of one another is unwavering and indestructible.”</p><p>He later sued Shakira for $250 million in 2012 but the lawsuit was dismissed by an LA County judge.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Osvaldo Rios (1997)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/osvaldo-rios.jpg><p>Shakira had a brief romance with Osvaldo Ríos in 1997.
