Sandoval was caught earlier this year cheating on long-term girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong></a> with her best friend, and fellow co-star, <a href=#><strong>Raquel Leviss</strong></a>. Schwartz apparently knew more than he let on -- certainly before the rest of the cast, including Ariana.</p><p>The whole thing blew up bigger than any reality show scandal probably had any right to, dominating mainstream media headlines and making household names out of the major players, and several other members of <a href=#><strong>Lisa Vanderpump's</strong></a> <a href=#><strong>"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"</strong></a> spinoff family.</p><p>Certainly, all that massive attention was more than any of them had anticipated or expected, making a getaway to the middle of nowhere Australia, a "welcome retreat" for Schwartz.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:cdbba7d5-3ea6-4741-8db5-244a6eaccef9 data-container-ref=toofab:article:3198f154-d347-45d6-bf96-32f3ea19afb2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b8/5by4/2023/06/08/b890badbfb1f4eccbb688b9c6375a05a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Vanderpump Rules Bombshell Moments: Ariana Eviscerates Raquel, Who Exposes Her & Tom's Lies</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I've been looking to get out of my little bubble that I've been in," he explained. "We all have problems and this past year-and-a-half to two years, I happen to have had a lot of them all at once. You know, when it rains it pours. So it was a nice little sabbatical."</p><p>For Schwartz, it was even more than the Scandoval, as Season 10 of the long-running reality show also covered his divorce from co-star <a href=#><strong>Katie Maloney</strong></a>, business struggles at one of his ventures with Sandoval, Schwartz & Sandy's, and health problems for his father and brother.</p><p>For Schwartz, that distance and how very different a competition-based reality show is to what he's used to helped him gain a fresh perspective on his life and career back home.</p><p>"I was able to step outside of my little bubble and be like, 'You know what? I'm so grateful," he shared. "I'm so lucky for all the opportunities I've been given and everything I've got to experience thus far in life."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a3fe7713-3e91-42dc-8e5f-3fdfd9918ff9 data-container-ref=toofab:article:3198f154-d347-45d6-bf96-32f3ea19afb2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/2c/5by4/2023/06/08/2c756555d9774fa0a5553633f3838f8a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Lala Kent's Thoughts on Raquel After 'Bombshell' Confession, Sandoval's 'Narcissistic' Tears and More</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>He also appreciated that he was able to be his own man after months of such a strong association with Sandoval and his associated cheating scandal. The separation from all of that for three weeks was "bliss."</p><p>While the cast was allowed their phones during filming, Schwartz actually said he'd have opted to not use his at all, except that it would be irresponsible as a business owner and "my mom would have killed me."</p><p>The whole experience would turn out to be life-altering for Schwartz after so many months of heaviness. "I felt like I was a little lighter on my feet when I got back here," he said. "My worries of the day all of a sudden didn't seem so worrisome."</p><p>He said that he felt "recalibrated," as if he'd reset his mind, body and soul. "I just felt like myself again," he explained.</p><p>Since his return, and in the lead-up to filming on Season 11 of "Vanderpump Rules" -- slated to begin in a few weeks -- Schwartz has been focusing his time and energy on Schwartz & Sandy's. As for his personal relationship with Sandoval, Schwartz echoed what he told Brittany Cartwright on her "When Reality Hits" podcast.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0d3939dd-6882-4b80-a606-8ce3235dd375 data-container-ref=toofab:article:3198f154-d347-45d6-bf96-32f3ea19afb2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e4/5by4/2023/06/08/e4688dfbf331440ab30df6a827945546_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Glamour</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Ariana Madix Says Sandoval's Deception Continued After Affair Was Exposed, Reacts to Claims It Was All Fake</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"It goes without saying: I didn't even have to say this verbatim to Tom [Sandoval], but I've just been taking a little break, am focusing on myself and, you know, I'm looking forward to this next chapter in my life," he said.</p><p>"I gotta be honest, I'm not super proud of the way I responded to adversity for the past year and a half," he continued. "I think I floundered a little bit. After my experience going to Australia, getting away for a while on a little sabbatical, I feel better equipped to handle whatever life throws at me now."</p><p>He encourages anyone, should they have the means, to try and find away to "take a little break from whatever you're going through" to get some literal and emotional and spiritual distance. That way, like him, you can come back "more confident and optimistic" about what's next.</p><p>What's next for Schwartz is a huge unknown. In the wake of the explosive Scandoval itself, as well a revelations that he'd continued to lie about the timeline of his affair during the reunion, the status of each cast member is unknown. They've weathered cheating scandals and drama before, but can they weather this?</p><a id=gallery-link-2ba5cd67-608d-4462-8e60-406e714e2a1b class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:2ba5cd67-608d-4462-8e60-406e714e2a1b data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:3198f154-d347-45d6-bf96-32f3ea19afb2 data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e6/4by3/2023/03/06/e6c42ba364a84997bd59e2b04f8ef053_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29manBfqbyuedKcn7CZoqnHbrLLnptmrpGjsaa%2Bz66kqWWiqrmmv4yrnK6mmaS7br%2FTmqmsZZ%2Bjeq6t0axm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./victoria-beckham-bans-exotic-animal-skins.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Victoria Beckham will no longer use exotic animal skins in her collections</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-keratin-shampoo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The 13 Best Keratin Shampoos in 2023: Oribe, Amika, More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
