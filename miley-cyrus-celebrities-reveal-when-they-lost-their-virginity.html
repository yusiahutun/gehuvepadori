I barely knew my own body," Khloe told <a href=#>HLN</a>.</p><p><strong>12. Chris Martin</strong></p><p>Coldplay's Chris Martin says he was 22 when he lost his virginity, telling <a href=#>The Standard</a>, "There were religious issues and s--t like that. Also confidence.

Sebastian Stan</strong></p><p>Sebastian Stan was a senior in high school, making him about 17 or 18.</p><p>"I think I lost my virginity pretty late. I was a senior in high school. I mean, that's late, right? I don't know. By today, probably ancient. But I did at the Time Hotel in Times Square. That's where I lost it.

Adam Lambert</strong></p><p>Adam Lambert opened up about losing his virginity on "<a href=#>E! True Hollywood Story</a>," sharing "I lost my virginity at 21, and it was to a man — not a woman.

Jessica Simpson</strong></p><p>Jessica Simpson waited until her wedding night at age 22. In her autobiography "Open Book," Jessica wrote, "I'd built up this anticipation in my mind that the first time I had sex with my husband had to be this transcendent experience where the heavens parted. What I didn’t know then is that everyone’s first time is awkward, and that is part of it. And that it’s OK, but at the time, it’s tough to understand."</p><a id=gallery-link-3f3544b7-f923-5557-8aa1-7335be4f87bc class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:3f3544b7-f923-5557-8aa1-7335be4f87bc data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:c6007576-2a4c-4d8d-b170-ba6b2c198331 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/57/4by3/2017/06/13/57cd1ded67125c1a8adbabdaf07532ba_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3F7j3Fma2lforatsdhmmrKqpah6pLHLnpmroaSesrR50Z6tnpmcYsSpsc1mq6GdqWK5sL%2FTZquhnZmnere10aCgp6Gkrnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ryan-gosling-has-never-been-so-genuine-since-he-dedicated-6-seconds-for-a-fan.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ryan Gosling has never been so genuine since he dedicated 6 seconds for a fan</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hong-kong-drama-series-banned-mainland.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hong Kong drama series banned on the mainland</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
