While there's nothing wrong with that, maybe it's time you gave controllers a chance. I did, and the experience was eye-opening.</p><h2 id=some-games-are-just-better-with-a-controller>Some Games Are Just Better With a Controller</h2><p>Some games are designed with controllers in mind, they just happen to work on a mouse and keyboard. Racing, fighting, and platform game fans know what I'm talking about. Developers create games that work on all popular platforms, which happens to include both consoles and PCs. It's worth noting that controllers have significantly fewer buttons, so developers often have to work around that fact to ensure you get the best experience possible, regardless of what platform you play your games on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What controllers lack in buttons, they make up for with pressure-sensitive inputs. Controllers have joysticks and trigger buttons that respond differently based on how much pressure you apply to them. This gives you a greater amount of control over what you do in-game. For instance, you can modulate the gas, brake, and steering in racing games. While you can do the same on so-called analog keyboards that utilize pressure-sensitive hall effect switches like the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Keychron Q1 HE</a>, they're relatively niche peripherals that most of us don't use.</p><p>Pressure-sensitive inputs aren't the only reason to pick up a controller. I find that RPGs and action-adventure games often play better on a controller as well. Games like Elden Ring, Monster Hunter: World, Diablo IV, and most <a href=# rel=nofollow>console ports</a> practically beg for a controller. Many were designed with a controller in mind, so motions and animations feel much smoother. You also get haptic feedback in the form of vibrations that add a nice immersive touch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Games that have combat systems where you lock the camera on one enemy by holding a trigger work flawlessly on controllers, whereas they feel awkward on a mouse and keyboard. It's true that with a single mouse flick you can rotate the camera a full 360 degrees or more. By contrast, a controller thumbstick moves the camera slowly, providing a smoother feel during combat.</p><p>This isn't to say that all RPGs play worse on a mouse and keyboard—World of Warcraft is a PC exclusive, Skyrim benefits from a whole keyboard's worth of key binds, and the Diablo series is a PC game at its core. Much of the time it depends on whether developers have put time and effort into making a game viable on a mouse and keyboard, which many of them still don't do.</p><h2 id=after-a-long-day-at-work-you-can-kick-back-on-the-couch>After a Long Day at Work, You Can Kick Back on the Couch</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/shutterstock_1891550179.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I don't think I've spent more than 10 hours gaming with a mouse and keyboard in the past three months. I bought my <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer sponsored" class="norewrite noskim">Xbox One Minecraft Pig Controller</a> so that I could play Rocket League with my friends, but I quickly discovered that I prefer to play most single-player games on a controller as well.</p><p>Granted, it could be the novelty factor because it's a new experience after spending two decades gaming on a mouse and keyboard, but I think that working from home is the straw that broke the camel's back. I can't even fathom the idea of sitting at my desk for even a second longer than I need to, especially after work hours.</p><p>I've talked to a few of my friends about this, and they all agreed that it's more fun to play on a controller if you're not playing a competitive multiplayer game. Just grab a wireless controller or an <a href=# rel=nofollow>extra-long USB cable</a>, hook up an HDMI cable to your TV, turn on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Steam Big Picture mode</a>, and enjoy your time off on a comfy couch or reclining office chair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=try-combining-a-mouse-keyboard-and-controller>Try Combining a Mouse, Keyboard, and Controller</h2><p>There's no arguing the fact that playing in a first-person perspective is better with a mouse and keyboard. A mouse allows you to control your aim quickly and precisely, whereas the right controller thumbstick only allows for slow and inaccurate camera control. That's the reason why most first-person shooters rely on some form of aim assist. Sometimes the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">aim assist is so strong</a> that gamers buy controllers just to benefit from it, but that's a topic for another time.</p><p>At the same time, controllers are more suitable for any form of driving and flying, activities you do a lot of in open-world games like Grand Theft Auto V, Cyberpunk: 2077, and even Starfield. So, why not combine the best of both worlds by swapping between the two depending on the scenario?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Personally, I find that driving on a keyboard is incredibly dull, and driving around Night City in Cyberpunk: 2077 is far more satisfying on a controller. It adds a bit of spice to the immersion: as your in-game character enters a car or plane, you reach for your controller. When the action starts, and you need precise aim, you can switch back to your mouse and keyboard instantly.</p><h2 id=love-emulators-you-rsquo-ll-need-a-controller>Love Emulators? You’ll Need a Controller</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/nintendo_64_controller.jpg><p>Most video game emulators all share one thing in common: the original games were designed to be played with a controller. While the controller layout on a Nintendo 64 isn't the same as on a modern Xbox controller, it's close enough, and the emulator takes the discrepancy into account. If you're serious about emulators, check out our list of the <a href=# rel=nofollow>best retro controllers for PC</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the same vein, most emulators were created for controllers, and some of them don't even work with a mouse and keyboard. I once tried Diablo on the now-defunct <a href=# rel=nofollow>Yuzu Switch emulator</a> using a mouse and keyboard, and it wasn't a pleasant experience.</p><h2 id=picking-the-right-controller-for-you>Picking the Right Controller for You</h2><p>A great place to start is with an <a href=# rel=nofollow>Xbox controller for gaming on Windows</a>. The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer sponsored" class="norewrite noskim">Xbox Core Wireless Controller</a> has excellent ergonomics, decent build quality, and at an affordable price. It makes for a solid entry-level controller, pair it with an optional rechargeable battery or plug it indirectly and you're good to go.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Third-party controllers are a lot better than they used to be</a>, but can be finicky and may require you to jump through a few hoops before they start working correctly. In contrast, first-party Xbox controllers are fully supported by Windows and work flawlessly. If you want a high-end variant, the obvious choice is the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer sponsored" class="norewrite noskim">Xbox Elite Series 2</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/xbox-core-controller.png><h5 class=display-card-title>Xbox Core Wireless Controller</h5>$49 <span class=regular-price>$65</span> Save $16<p class=display-card-description>One of the best controllers you can buy, regardless of platform.

I used <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">DualSenseX Windows Drivers</a> to play Forza Horizon 5, and once I set it up, it worked flawlessly.

Hall effect joysticks are impressively smooth and don't develop stick drift. A great one for emulators is the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer sponsored" class="norewrite noskim">8BitDo Ultimate Wireless Controller</a>. If you want something more retro, 8BitDo has a selection of classic controllers. One of the best is the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer sponsored" class="norewrite noskim">8BitDo SN30 Pro</a> because it sports modern Hall effect joysticks in an old package, but you can't go wrong with any of them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For more recommendations, check out our <a href=# rel=nofollow>list of the best PC gaming controllers</a>. Just avoid buying super cheap controllers because most of them have shoddy build quality. Their thumbsticks and trigger buttons tend to become unresponsive within a few months of use, so it's best to buy something that lasts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGiuobFdmsOmvthmp5xll5a6pr6MrJ%2BorZyZeqmt1Z5kmmWTpLu1vs6lo56qXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./64956417268e3e50278b45a9-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dos empleados de la empresa del sumergible 'Titan' denunciaron que los materiales &amp;quot;no resistan en</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tim-black-discusses-the-story-behind-one-of-his-most-personal-books.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tim Black Discusses The Story Behind One Of His Most Personal Books</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
