But what is astrocartography, and how can one get the best astrocartography reading?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/649b31116d5b0d44.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is Raven method shifting?

It uses an individual's birth chart to pinpoint areas on the Earth that are conducive to their growth and personal development. When people identify these points, they can gain insight into the places they should visit or live in to benefit their lives.</p><p class=align-left>An astrocartography reading typically involves mapping out the natal positions of the planets. Then, one must look out at the placements of the planets in relation to the Earth and analyse the resulting patterns and influences. The goal is determining the best places to live, work, or travel. Furthermore, the reading can provide insight into the energies of a location and how they may impact a person's life.</p><h2>How to interpret an astrocartography chart</h2><p class=align-left>The astrocartography chart is a map of the locations you should visit to gain the most benefit from the planets, stars, and other celestial bodies in your birth chart. The lines drawn on the chart represent the areas of influence. Therefore, you can use them to identify the locations that will bring the most significant positive effects into your life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2b9a03cf2a936f0f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Vibrating pill, ingestible sensor: mini robots tackle gut disorders</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Therefore, the most important thing to consider when looking at an astrocartography chart or getting an astrocartography reading online is the lines drawn on the map since each line is associated with a particular planet or star. For example, if you were to look at your astrocartography chart and see a line associated with Mars, this line would signify an area of influence related to<a href=#> courage, strength</a>, and action. By living in or travelling to this area, you could experience these qualities more fully and gain insight into how they can be applied to your life.</p><p class=align-left>In addition to looking at the lines of influence, it is also essential to consider the signs and symbols associated with each line when getting astrocartography reading free online. These signs and symbols can provide additional information about the area and help you gain insight into the location's energy.</p><h2>What is the best line to live on in astrocartography?</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b0ef61e9a08d2895.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Degree in Land Survey in Kenya: Course requirements, colleges offered</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/649b31116d5b0d44.jpg><p class=align-left>The best line to live on in astrocartography will depend on which planet you are looking to benefit from or improve your personal development. Generally, Sun, Venus, and Jupiter are the best lines to live on. Additionally, lines of neutral planets like Mercury can be beneficial to live on because they provide more balanced energy. However, some avoid lines of malefic planets like Mars and Saturn because many believe they can bring about more negative energies.</p><p class=align-left>But as a consensus on the best astrocartography reading, Jupiter is the most beneficial line to live under because it can bring success, prosperity, social acceptance, and often a lot of fun. However, others consider the Sun line the best to live on because it symbolises confidence, power and reputation.</p><h2>What does each line mean in astrocartography?</h2><p class=align-left>In astrocartography, there are four lines for each celestial body.
