Apart from that, he has gained a lot of attention with songs like Kilos in my bag, Molly Cyrus, and One Million Dimes.</p><p>This musician had some bills to settle with his fellow rappers, which attracted a lot of media attention and also got him more attention. For example, he released the title Don’t Fear Death, which was aimed at The Game. It was reported that he was hit in the face and knocked out by the rapper’s manager, Wack 100.</p><p>There are more dramas about this guy, we learn more about his biography, his career, his wealth, his family, and even about his features, we covered almost everything.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Stitches-Rapper.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Stitches’ Bio</strong></h2><p>It is common knowledge that Stitches was born on June 17, 1995, as the son of Esther and Alex Katsabanis and that his birthplace is in Miami, Florida, U.S.A. He is one of the non-black rappers in the music business because he is of Cuban and Greek descent. His parents’ relationship ended when he was just one year old and he has two older siblings from his parents’ marriage – brothers, Alex Jr. and Dimitri. He attended G. Holmes Braddock High School in Miami-Dade County, which he later left.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who is Frank Kaminsky of NBA, His Salary, Height, Weight and Other Facts</a></strong></p><p>There are rumors that he was expelled from school for punching the principal in the face. Rumor has it that Stitches moved to South Beach, Florida, and devoted himself to selling drugs and guns to make ends meet. This report is supported by several allegations by his siblings; by all indications, his bad-boy act began long before he appeared on the music scene and thrilled hip-hop lovers.</p><p>Stitches began his rap career under the stage name Lil Phil. In 2012 he released My Name Lil Phil, but gave up the nickname at age 16 and began working under the stage name Stitches. His debut mixtape entitled “No Snitching Is My Statement” was released in 2014. The tape produced the hit Brick in Yo Face, and his video has since been viewed over 26 million times on YouTube. In 2015, he went even further by releasing two more mixtapes, Brick Bible and Supple and Demand, and finally followed that same year with the release of his debut album, For Drug Dealers Only.</p><p>The following year saw the release of his second album, Tales of a Drug Lord. The album contained the title Pain and Success, which was well received. In 2017 he started the following projects: I need rehab, Cocaine Holiday, and The trap house.</p><p>The rapper’s music is inspired by musicians like Gucci Mane, Whiz Khalifa, and Juicy J, who have impressed the music audience with their talents. He has also been inspired by the artistry of acts like Trace Cyrus, Blac Youngsta, Compton Menace, and Fat Trel.</p><p>Stitches’ profile has not helped to counteract the stereotype of crime and violence associated with rappers in the music business. He has been arrested several times; in 2017 he was charged in Miami, Florida, on charges of drug and gun possession. Police found in his possession grass, a gun, ammunition, and several other incriminating items. His lawyer was able to offer him a good deal in the case of firearms.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>His Wife, Divorce, and Kids</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Stitches-with-his-daughter.jpg><p>Stitches were formerly married to Erica Duarte, who waited eleven years for him; when he married her, he was just seventeen years old. She was his legal assistant before she became his wife in the fall of 2012. Erica Duarte was featured in Paris Hilton’s My New BFF in 2008. The couple separated in 2017 after five years of marriage, and Erica Duarte has been at rock bottom since their divorce.</p><p>Their union produced three children, Rex, Rocco, and Evelyn.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Rudy Gobert Height, Weight, Parents, Girlfriend, NBA Career Profile</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Net Worth – How Rich Is Stitches Rapper?</strong></h2><p>It is said that this rapper has an estimated net worth of $500,000. With his microphone skills and bad-boy image, Katsabanis was able to attract over 1.6 million fans on <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> and nearly 500k subscribers on his YouTube channel. While these are ways that helped him accumulate his wealth, much of his wealth came from his musical career. Although it is widely believed that drug trafficking is the main source of his wealth, we cannot confirm this feeling.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Stitches Rapper Height and Body Features</strong></h2><p>The Brick in Yo Face-Rapper is a big guy and stands at 186 cm (6 Ft 1 inch). He is also chubby. The rapper has tattoos with stitches across his mouth to support his nickname. He also has a teddy bear tattooed on his forehead, Ak-47 tattoos, and the word cocaine on his arm.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is He Dead?</strong></h2><p>Lately, rumors about the rapper’s death have been circulating on social media with pictures and articles. He has not made a vociferous attempt to directly dispel the rumors, which only makes it look like a publicity gag to further boost the rapper’s career. To the best of his knowledge, Stitches the Rapper is very much alive.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kwLW105yfnqtdp66xvMSrZLChlpp6pbXVqKmcnV2gtqW%2FjKGcop%2BYqXqvsdNmrqiqpJ16qr%2BMoZxmnJWWsXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./death-doula-millennials.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Death Doula Business Is Booming, Especially Among Millennials</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./miley-cyrus-dating-history.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Miley Cyrus's Complete Dating History</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
