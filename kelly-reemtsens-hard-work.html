In response to a 1950‘s survey-ad asking, “Should women be able to water the lawn?” Reemtsen has spent the past decade answering that question with her oil-paintings of retro-styled women holding such tools as garden hoses, axes, shovels, chainsaws, etc. Cliché talks to Reemtsen about her work and its impact on women.<br><a href=#><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async alt=BowStudy src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/clichemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BowStudy-500x446.jpg width=350 height=312 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><br><strong>Cliché: You have a very unique style that features retro-fashion, household items, pills, etc. Where did this begin?<br></strong><strong>Kelly Reemtsen:</strong> I started 15 years ago with still life paintings of vintage dresses on dress forms. (I used to paint shoes and bags as well, so one could assemble themselves a full wardrobe, if they wished.) I was already collecting and wearing vintage dresses and thought they might make for fabulous subjects. They are very feminine and have a great shape for painting. And I love the full skirts. When trying to decide which dresses to paint, I’m attracted first to the color of the dress, then to its shape.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>Most of your paintings focus on retro-dressed women holding items that could be either domestic tools or dangerous weapons. Which way do you wish your audience to perceive this?<br></strong>I use the tool to represent hard work. The more aggressive the tool, the harder the job.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async alt=ForgetMeNot src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/clichemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ForgetMeNot-500x500.jpg width=350 height=350 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><strong>Is the fashion featured in your work a reflection of your own personal style or taste?<br></strong>Yes and no. I like to put on an awesome dress for an evening out, but I usually wear darker colors. For my paintings, I’m attracted to bright pop colors, but I prefer to blend into the crowd in a way I could not if I wore the dresses I paint.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>You often paint your female subjects from the neck down, never including their faces. What statement are you making with this strategy?<br></strong>I like the female viewer to see her self in the painting. If it was a portrait of someone specific, this idea would not work. I love overhearing women at an exhibition say, “That is me.”</p><p dir=ltr><strong>Congratulations on your first published book, I’m Falling! What was that process and outcome like for you?<br></strong>It definitely was a labor of love. Emphasis on Labor. My friend Chris Fogg (Fogg & Associates) approached me about doing the book. When I saw the truly awesome design by Stephanie Meadows (of Fogg & Associates), I took a year to paint all new work for the book. I photographed the painting and my friend Vanessa Stump shot my sculpture and studio. It was designed in Manchester, England and Printed in Leeds, England. There were many 2 a.m. (Los Angeles time) Skype meetings. It started as a three person project and then blossomed into a huge group effort, which I feel was an amazing experience, and I loved working with each and everyone of them. I feel that together we created the book I envisioned.</p><p dir=ltr><a href=#><img decoding=async alt=Clipped src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/clichemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Clipped-500x500.jpg width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p dir=ltr><strong>From the dresses, to the tools, how do you go about picking and choosing what goes into a portrait?<br></strong>I start with color and pattern and, depending on my mood, I pick what interests me that day. I put it on a model. I shoot it a bunch of different ways with different tools, different lighting. And then I end up using the shot that appeals to me most.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>Tell me about your creative process. Does the setting have to be a certain way? &nbsp;</strong><br>My studio has to be really clean and orderly, because clutter slows me down. I usually don’t sit down to paint until 3 p.m. at the earliest, and I hit my stride around 7 or 8 p.m. Often I’m working until four in the morning.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>When did you realize oil painting was your favorite medium?</strong><br>Since primary school. I love the smell. Oil paint is amazing, you can turn it into anything.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>You’ve already accomplished so much with your artistic career. What’s next?</strong><br>Some days I feel like I’m just getting started. That is the BIG question always on my mind. “How do I evolve as an artist?” Not change, but evolve. Hmmm. I guess I will know when I see it.</p><p><span class=Apple-style-span><b id=docs-internal-guid--d2b81a0-65e5-9c6c-66e7-a95d66726410>To see more of Kelly’s work, visit her website at kellyreemtsen.com</b></span><br><i>Kelly Reemtsen’s interview originally appeared in Cliché Magazine’s February/March 2014 issue.<br></i><i>Images courtesy of&nbsp;Kelly Reemtsen.&nbsp;</i></p><p dir=ltr>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnJ6wqbHMmp5nm5%2BifKK%2B02iinqScrnqzscSmq6ydnqh6qa3RnWSwp6KgfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./miles-roosevelt-bialik-stone.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Miles Roosevelt Bialik Stone - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./495767-astrocartography-reading-guide-how-interpret-chart.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Astrocartography reading guide: How to interpret the chart</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
