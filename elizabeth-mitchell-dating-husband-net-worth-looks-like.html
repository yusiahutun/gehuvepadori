This is how she fell in love with the world of acting and entertainment as a fan. Also when her mom attended law school back in the days, she used to drop her off at a theatre school. Eventually still very young Elizabeth knew she was going to become an actress.</p><p>Fast forward to today and we have a successful American actress with lead roles such as Juliet Burke on the ABC drama mystery series Lost and the recurring Snow Queen on Once Upon a Time.</p><p>Early in 2022 as Elizabeth joined FBI: International in the recurring role of Angela Cassidy, a government agent and the long-missing mother of Scott Forrester (actor Luke Kleintank), fans were wondering — if she is dating or if she has a husband and more — all of which we are about to cover in the rest of this writing.</p><h3><strong>Is Elizabeth Mitchell Dating Anyone After The Divorce From Chris Soldevilla?</strong></h3><p>Elizabeth Mitchell, who is not to be confused with folk-rock singer of the same name, married improvisation actor Chris Soldevilla on 13 June 2004 and parted ways sometime in 2013. So other than a failed marriage they now share a son named Christopher Joseph Soldevilla Jr. who they happily welcomed on 4 December 2005. And for as long as they were together, they lived in Bainbridge Island, Washington, with their son. In 2014, following divorce, Mitchell purchased a ranch in Bainbridge Island, Washington.</p><p>The now-estranged couple cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for their separation.</p><p>Now, as for, if or not Elizabeth Mitchell is dating anyone — the only man who is featured on her social media from time to time is Jordan Arnold (on Instagram @stockoption and Twitter @jordanarnold). As per BIO on these platforms, Jordan is a proud co-founder of Lightfox Games, that in his words, is “friends making games for friends.”</p><p>Elizabeth posed in a couple of cozy snaps with Jordan where they seem so much like a couple. And these pictures are from November in 2019, January 2020, and likewise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/elizabeth-mitchell-dating-husband-net-worth-looks-like-2022-1-300x284.jpg><p>In August 2021, Jordan said, on his Instagram, that he was tricked which was so unlike him as he is usually hard to surprise. He said, “Liz” (his name for Elizabeth) said she was booking a weekend getaway for his birthday. The location was to be a surprise. But then he said some Airbnb confirmation emails went to him instead of Elizabeth. And though initially, it seemed like the surprise was ruined, he was still “giddy” to get to go on a trip for his birthday.</p><p>So, even here, from the way Jordan talked about Elizabeth, who planned a surprise birthday getaway with his likely friend/family Dominic, he seemed to have romantic feelings for her.</p><p>(Of course) now Jordan was labeled as Elizabeth’s ‘boyfriend’ on her Biography on her official website.</p><p>Lastly, let us tell you what Jordan said about quarantining with Elizabeth during the COVID pandemic. “Happy Birthday @elizabeth.mitchell.official. You’re kind, creative, brilliant, stunning, inquisitive, and truly hilarious. There’s nobody I’d rather be quarantined with for a global pandemic”, he expressed wishing her on her birthday.</p><h3><strong>Is Elizabeth Mitchell Former Husband Chris Soldevilla Married Now?</strong></h3><p>Chris, 51-year-old as of February 2021 and known for his works in Coyote Ugly (2000), The Wedding Pact (2014), and My Dinner with Jimi (2003), has kept his Instagram <a href=#>@csoldevilla</a> on private mode. That is one of the many reasons we could not tell you if he is married again or just dating or single.</p><p>So you know, it was not his first time getting married to Elizabeth. From January April 2001 until January 2003, he was married to&nbsp;Bedazzled and Sluts & Losers actress Christine Cameron.</p><p>Since June 2006, Christine has been married to producer/cinematographer Mark Holder and they have two kids together.</p><h3><strong>Elizabeth Mitchell Net Worth</strong></h3><p>celebritynetworth.com cited Elizabeth Mitchell to have cumulated an estimated $3 million net worth by 2014.</p><h3><strong>Elizabeth Mitchell Looks Like</strong></h3><p>So, some of you must have noticed how closely Elizabeth Mitchell looks like the Gossip Girl star Kelly Rutherford as well as the&nbsp;Dead to Me&nbsp;star Christina Applegate.
