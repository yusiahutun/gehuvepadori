She looks for new projects that promise a good experience. “This is a point in my life where I would rather not have drama,” Loni says. “I want to have a fun time with fun people. I am looking for the joy in whatever I’m doing.”</p><p>She admits she’d love a chance to play against type someday. “I always wanted to play someone inherently evil and mysterious,” confesses the actress, who is also still drawn to comedies. “The most tempting role is if I get to be funny around funny people,” she says.</p><p>Since 2008, Loni’s been married to musician <a href=#><strong>Bob Flick</strong></a>. She first met this founding member of the folk group the Brothers Four back in the 1960s. “I was 17 and he was 24. I was just crazy about his music,” remembers Loni.</p><p>“Then we had a whole span of time where we didn’t see one another. I saw him on PBS, of all things, doing one of those pledge shows.” Loni reached out, sparks reignited and the rest is history!</p><p>The actress is also very close to her two adult children, daughter Deidra, from her first marriage, and son Quinton, whose father was her Stroker Ace costar Burt Reynolds. Although the couple’s 1994 <a href=#>divorce</a> was a tabloid sensation, Loni looks back at the 12 years they were together with affection.</p><p>“I’m the kind of person who chooses the happy memories, because it’s ridiculous to dwell on the negative,” she says of Burt, who passed away in 2018. “He was my friend first, he was my friend at the end. He introduced me to some of the most glamorous people I never would have met. And we have this wonderful son.”</p><p>As the holiday season gets rolling, Loni is looking forward to the time she’ll spend with her family. “The cooking is big!” she says. “We have all these family recipes, and we always congregate in the kitchen. The main tradition is that we are all together.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46lpqehXZa7pbHRrKanZZ%2Bjeq%2Bx1madnp2cYrSwu8Nmo6Kelam2rrGMnJ%2BroaOpuqK%2FjKamr6GVZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./400072-50-funny-wedding-captions-instagram-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>50+ funny wedding captions for Instagram</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-have-period-sex.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to Have Sex on Your Period</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
