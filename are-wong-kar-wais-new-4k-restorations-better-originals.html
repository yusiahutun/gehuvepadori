The director’s debut, As Tears Go By, and 2046, Wong’s pseudo-sequel to In the Mood for Love, are unchanged except for the shiny new visuals of Wong’s 1988 debut, which has never looked better.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Of the more noteworthy changes made to his other films, Wong has written in his director’s note: “During the process of restoring the pictures … we were caught in a dilemma between restoring these films to the form in which the audience had remembered them and how I had originally envisioned them. There was so much that we could change, and I decided to take the second path as it would represent my most vivid vision of these films.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/03/12/36b3b6b4-5e6f-4688-a654-1dffcb7a37bc_d3a013a9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite talk of a new “vivid vision” for his work, some of Wong’s creations have only received minor tweaks. Both Wong’s international breakthrough successes <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Chungking Express</span></a> and In the Mood for Love have had their aspect ratios adjusted – from the 1.85:1 of previous home releases to their original theatrical ratio of 1.66:1 – and had their sound remixed.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1eav71q e1haapfp2">We were caught in a dilemma between restoring these films to the form in which the audience had remembered them and how I had originally envisioned themWong Kar-wai</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although not mentioned in Wong’s own press release regarding these restorations, the colours have also been updated for the new releases of these two films.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In previous releases Chungking Express had a brighter, more stark appearance, one fitting for the harshly lit locations – the Midnight Express diner, 7-Eleven – where much of the film takes place. The new colours are more even and natural, but lack the fluorescent look that was appropriate for much of Chungking Express.</p>A greener tint is now present in In the Mood for Love. Although the change adds a certain nostalgic wash to the visuals, it also muddies many of the vibrant colours that infuse the film, in particular the vibrant patterns on <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Maggie Cheung’s famous cheongsams</span></a>.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/03/12/b127f865-46e0-43a8-94b5-e4b370fe0d59_d11c7421.jpg>A similar green tint is prevalent in the new Days of Being Wild, otherwise largely unchanged in these restorations, but <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Wong’s longstanding director of photography Christopher Doyle</span></a> reportedly said the film was meant to have a green look – something absent in most home releases apart from the Japanese DVD. The change is fine for the most part but it is notably excessive in a handful of scenes.Wong’s Happy Together, for which he won best director at the Cannes Film Festival, has been on the receiving end of minor cuts – although Wong claims they were enforced by necessity as certain original negatives of the film were lost in a fire. The result is that some of <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Tony Leung Chiu-wai</span></a>’s voice-over monologues have been shortened. The affected sequences are far from ruined, with the director assuring fans that “we managed to restore most of the scenes to better quality”.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, Wong’s inadvertent claim that there is not a single duplicate negative in existence anywhere in the world seems dubious. Had he wished to, it is likely the scenes could have been fully restored – films can and have been restored from interpositives and release prints. It seems more likely that Wong wanted to leave these scenes slimmed down.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1eav71q e1haapfp2">As the saying goes: no man ever steps in the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and he’s not the same manWong Kar-wai</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The film with the most significant changes is Fallen Angels. Released in 1995 as a slightly more experimental continuation of Chungking Express – the hitman storyline was originally conceived as a third strand for Wong’s previous film – every shot of Fallen Angels has been retouched.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Alongside Doyle Wong has, as with Chungking Express and In the Mood for Love, colour-graded the film in a completely different tone. Certain shots originally in colour have been transformed to black and white, while selective colouring has been undertaken in other scenes, too.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Most notable of all is Fallen Angels’ new aspect ratio. This film is famous for its slightly distorted appearance due to the use of a super-wide angle 6.5mm camera lens during filming. For this restoration Wong has changed the aspect ratio in a significant manner, switching it from 1.85:1 to 2.39:1. The result is that each shot of the film is now cropped closer and looks squished and deformed compared to the former presentation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/03/12/4f275329-86ca-4cf8-b726-16a385044017_6e2fd0de.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wong says the film’s new ratio is “originally what I had intended to release the film in” but the new aspect ratio and attendant crops have received mixed reviews. To some it enhances the awkward spatial set-up of the film, while to others it is pure vandalism.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“People like you are hung up on freshness,” exclaims Takeshi Kaneshiro in Chungking Express, but whether these new versions are better or worse than the originals is up for debate.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even before this collection Wong’s oeuvre was littered with numerous different editions of his films – there are three different cuts of The Grandmaster varying from 130 to 123 to 108 minutes long; the “Hong Kong” cut of Chungking Express is four minutes shorter than the international version; Ashes of Time Redux varies significantly from the Ashes debuted in 1994; the Japanese version of Happy Together has its own tweaks; an extended cut of Days of Being Wild is being released as an extra alongside the new restoration. All these different versions exist – and that’s without counting things like the original Cannes’ cuts of 2046 and The Grandmaster, which were heavily revised before public release.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/03/12/3ea4438e-b3f2-4cb2-8367-0cbe5130b3d8_92c91ea6.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What then counts as the “definitive” version of nearly any Wong Kar-wai film? Wong himself seems unsure. For these restorations he wrote: “As the saying goes: no man ever steps in the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and he’s not the same man.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Since the beginning of this process, these words have reminded me to treat this as an opportunity to present these restorations as a new work from a different vantage point in my career.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Having arrived at the end of this process, these words still hold true. I invite the audience to join me on starting afresh, as these are not the same films, and we are no longer the same audience.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Just as Chow Mo-wan changes from hesitant lover In the Mood for Love into a wandering playboy in 2046, so it seems that Wong’s films will continue to evolve over time – as they already have done.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Want more stories like this?
