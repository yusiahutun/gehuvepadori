If you have larger breasts that hurt when you lie down, or you don’t feel fully comfortable when your girls are unsupported, then sleeping in a bra can be a great solution, as it works to keep everything in place, counteracting good old gravity and subsequently boosting your chances of quality zzz’s.</p><p>For some, a sleep bra might be one with lots of extra support that keeps breasts from falling to the side. For others, <a href=# rel=noopener>a seamless brassiere</a> that’s free of pokey wires or clasps will do the trick: It’s all about you and your individual comfort.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is it bad to sleep with a bra on?</strong></h2><p>There are numerous reports online that claim sleeping in a bra can have negative effects on your health, but according to New York-based <a href=#>Dr. Amber Guth</a>, M.D., there’s no truth to any of that. As she explained to the <a href=#>Huffington Post</a> in 2015, “There is certainly no evidence that sleeping in bras is either helpful or harmful.”</p><p>Rather, it all comes down to what makes you feel best when you’re ready to catch some shut-eye.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What makes a good sleep bra?</strong></h2><p>When shopping for a sleep bra, the most important thing to consider is fit. As Dr. Guth explained, “No bra or breast support should be so tight that it constricts or blocks any form of circulation.”</p><p>Instead, you’ll want to look for a bra that holds you in securely, but never too tightly. (Those with trouble finding their perfect fit can try this genius <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Soma Innofit smart bra</a>: read more about them <a href=#>here</a>.) You’ll also probably want to opt for something that’s free of pesky seams, painful wires, or ouch-inducing clasps that can dig into your skin or pinch you as you doze.</p><p>Another factor to consider is fabric. For optimal sleeping conditions, your bra should be stretchy, lightweight, and breathable (you don’t want to be sweating under the covers!), so that it feels as if it’s not even there.</p><p>We’ve done the research to uncover 10 fantastic options for women of all cup sizes that will not only be perfect for sleeping in, they’ll be great wearing out into the world! <strong>Keep scrolling to shop FIRST for Women’s picks for the most comfortable sleep bras for a great night’s slumber.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Best Sleep Bras for Women</h2><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Soft Supportive Seamless Modal Racer Bralette</a></h2><span class=block-product__eyebrow>Best Supportive sleep bra</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/02/Lunya-Support-Sleep-Bra.jpg><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Lunya, $58</a></strong></p><h3 class=block-product-list__title>Why we like it:</h3><ul><li>Wide straps</li></ul><ul><li>Stretchy</li></ul><ul><li>Size range</li></ul><p>Founded in 2014, Lunya aims to “[reinvent] sleepwear for the modern woman” with comfortable, flattering pieces that are designed to help you get a better night’s rest.
