We've mined celebrity outfits for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>clues about their personal lives</a>, and have come to spot rainbows as a proud representation of the LGBTQ community. Sometimes, a symbolic bit of style could be marching right in front of you, speaking a sinister meaning you'd never expect.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Take Hawaiian shirts, for instance. Did you know that they're being used as a dog whistle for the white supremacist movement?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Reece Jones, PhD, a political geography professor at the University of Hawaii who is currently writing a book on anti-immigrant groups, exposed this culture clash in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>now-viral Twitter thread</a>, which explains how the typically happy, casual, '<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>dad-shirt</a>' of the Polynesian islands has become associated with the alt-right. Unfortunately, the shirt style, along with other "far right iconography" you'd glance right past if you didn't know (such as igloos), keep popping up at protests, and it's important to be aware of what it's being used to represent. Especially if you, like us, had just become convinced <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Aloha shirts were the laidback style to live in for Summer 2020</a>. (Our bad.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Part of the strategy of white supremacists is to disguise themselves behind new names and seemingly innocent symbols," Jones explains to InStyle via email. "No one identifies as KKK or a Nazi. Instead, they use terms like alt right, groyper, or boogaloo, that mean the same thing but do not yet have the same negative connotations. Similarly, everyone recognizes a swastika, so modern day racists co-opt other symbols like the OK sign, Pepe the Frog, and now, unfortunately, aloha shirts."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's a bit of backstory on how the latter came to be.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So many movies that were initially panned somehow end up with cult followings, and such was the case with this 1984 flop about breakdancing. Fans of this sequel eventually connected through message boards on Reddit, 4chan, and 8chan, sharing jokes and memes about the film, but, as Jones pointed out in his thread, the radical far right gathers on those sites as well. They use boards like /pol/ to discuss politics, and there are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>ones dedicated to being "politically incorrect,"</a> where they use racial slurs and hate speech. Niche memes flourish here, which is how Pepe the Frog got involved. One major idea they discuss — and especially on 4chan's /k/, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>a gun worship board</a> — is how the government is coming to take their guns away. Seemingly the weird movie fandom and gun fanaticism have nothing to do with one another, but wait.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The Second Civil War</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Obviously, people have a lot of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>thoughts about gun control</a>, and the radicals that we mentioned are very much against it. In 2012, when California's then-lieutenant governor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Gavin Newsom addressed the National Rifle Association</a> in a Facebook post, saying he was "coming for your guns," they latched onto that — and were ready to fight back. There was a lot of talk about a second Civil War, and infamously inflammatory host <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Alex Jones kept pushing the idea</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Those who believe this war is imminent do not always share the same overall ideas, and they're not all white supremacists. Some are intense gun rights activists and are associated with the militia movement. As CNN points out, many are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>anti-government extremists</a>. However, Jones (Reece, not Alex) stated in another tweet that for others, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>it is about race</a>. "They believe immigration is leading to the great replacement," he said. They are white nationalists, and a Tolerance.org article further explains this, saying that these people believe there is a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>white genocide happening.</a></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Protestors call for Governor Chris Sununu to reopen the state while outside the New Hampshire State House on May 2, 2020.

Jones briefly mentions this in his thread, and it basically boils down to weird Internet word play. Over time, Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo was shortened to just "the Boogaloo" on chat boards and — likely due to the way the word boogaloo sounds — later became "Big igloo." Another term that was derived from boogaloo was "Big Luau," which directly connects to the attire one would wear to a luau, aka Hawaiian shirts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">An Anti-Defamation League article also notes that, at one point, people began putting different things in front of the first part of Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>interchanging the "Breakin' 2" part</a> with random phrases or titles. Someone came up with Civil War 2: Electric Boogaloo, and connected it with the Gavin Newsom quote, which tied the two worlds together.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Hawaiian Shirts</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once "Big Luau" merged with Civil War 2, Hawaiian shirts (and, sometimes, igloos) became symbols representing the ideas of this alt-right group. Remember when crowds were protesting for the states to re-open, even though people were and are still dying from Covid-19? Many were wearing Hawaiian shirts. And, it's not just shirts, either; there are also guns with aloha patterns now, which some of those anti-government, anti-shutdown protestors carried with them. Because, did we mention, they love their guns?</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The Current Protests</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>protests began following the death of George Floyd</a>, these radical 'Boogaloo bois' (another name for the group) saw it as an opportunity to further their agenda, too. They began showing up to the protests <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>wearing Hawaiian shirts</a>, as Esquire reports, which can now mean one of two things. Some of these Hawaiian-shirt-wearers actually are calling for justice for George, because they were already against the police, the military, and the government. They see this man's murder as proof of why they need to fight back, to take power away from the police (and, no less frighteningly, put it in their own hands). But, there are the white supremacists in the mix, who are ready for their supposed race war to begin. In both cases, the Boogaloo bois are willing to incite violence to reach their desired outcome, and there are plenty of photos of white men in Hawaiian shirts destroying property and touting rifles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Clearly, this radical group is taking advantage of the situation in order to further their cause of destruction and harm. This presents a challenge for Black Lives Matter protesters: to be louder than they are, shut down their racist and violent plans with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>data and facts</a>, and continue to educate them on the many ways they are wrong.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Thankfully more people know what to look for now and are asking them to leave," Jones says. "The FBI also arrested three people, who identify as part of boogaloo [and were armed with Molotov cocktails], for terrorism in Las Vegas."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for whether you can keep wearing Hawaiian shirts, Jones says yes. "As long as you do not accessorize it with body armor and a long gun, it is fine." And we get it — we <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>just got into this trend,</a> and we don't want to let the few bad actors take it away. That said, just to be safe, maybe choose something else to wear to a protest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3yprdaaoKKZnmLAqbXRrapmmZyperO1xqGrZq%2BYnsGmedKup6udnZawunnPq6atnaOpvLO%2F</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./liset-meruelo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Liset Meruelo Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./elle-brooke-reveals-dream-threesome-32070203.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Elle Brooke reveals 'dream threesome' as she strips to tiny bikinis in Dubai</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
