Lauded for his work that fuses elements of traditional Chinese culture with Western influences, “Uncle Kan” is a dedicated educator who has been an inspiration to the new generation of Chinese designers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I believe that in each era certain things can be appreciated for a very long time, even after the passing of that period. The Chinese culture is rich and deep; there are so many different layers to it [that may manifest themselves] as a pattern, a way of thinking or an attitude towards life. This is what has been passed on to us, from generation to generation,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kan, who is from Panyu in Guangdong province, came to Hong Kong in 1957 at the age of 15. He was a tailor by day and a painter by night before moving into design in the late 1960s. The brain behind an array of brand logos, stamps, magazines and posters, Kan has won hundreds of awards in the past 45 years. He was the first designer to receive the “Hong Kong Ten Outstanding Young Persons” honour in 1979 and the first Chinese to be included in Who’s Who in Graphic Design of Switzerland</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">in 1995. In 2000, he was selected as one of the 2,000 outstanding artists and designers of the 20th century in Britain. In 2010, he was awarded the Silver Bauhinia Star by the Hong Kong government. One of Kan’s most successful designs is the Bank of China logo. It comprises a circle encompassing a square and resembles an ancient Chinese coin, which references the bank’s function. The design was inspired by the age-old concept of fangyuan (“square-circle”) that describes our ancestors’ curiosity in and understanding of the unknown universe.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The design is clean and simple. When people look at it they know what it represents. There is a modern touch, too. The dimensions of the square are that of a computer screen,” says Kan, who is director of Kan & Lau Design Consultants. “The logo has been around for over 30 years. I think it will remain representative in the next 50 years.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Believing that more young people should have the opportunity to study design, Kan tried his hand at teaching in 1970 and has since taken an active role in promoting design education in Hong Kong, the mainland and abroad. He is a popular speaker, adviser to design associations and a prolific writer. Kan recently retired from being the dean of the Cheung Kong School of Art and Design in Shantou.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I learn so much from teaching young people. I do a lot of research as I prepare for class, and when I discuss matters with my students, I am absorbing new ideas from them as much as they from me,” Kan says. “I want to let them know that designers should be concerned about the environment and should care for the disadvantaged.”</p><img aria-label=loading data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets-v2.i-scmp.com/production/_next/static/media/wheel-on-gray.af4a55f9.gif style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdlp5bBpLTErGaaqqSesK2xjmpncG1jZ39wssCmoKWhkad6sa3TrZyrpl2dvLh506uYnaGknryveceaqmahnpu5trHNnJydZZGnwaq%2F02aimqY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./strawberry-graham-icebox-cake.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>strawberry graham icebox cake</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./emma-stone-louis-vuitton-paris-show-corset-top.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Emma Stone Wears Corset and Mini Jacket to Louis Vuitton's Paris Show</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
