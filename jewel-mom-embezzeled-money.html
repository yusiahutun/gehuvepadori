I woke up and realized she embezzled all of my money, over $100 million,"&nbsp;the "You Were Meant for Me" hitmaker reveals&nbsp;in a new&nbsp;<a href=#>episode</a> of the Verywell Mind Podcast with Amy Morin.</p><p>"And then as I started investigating the truth about what my mom had told me in my life versus what was true, I had realized that pretty much everything I formed my reality on was fiction,"&nbsp;Jewel adds.</p><p>The podcast focuses on health and wellness, specifically when it comes to mental health. In the episode, Jewel — full name Jewel Kilcher — details how discovering her mother's wrongdoings have affected her mentally.</p><p>"Thirty-four years old, realize I'm $3 million in debt, realize my mom stole it, realize everything I thought my mom was, isn't what she was, very difficult psychological thing to come to terms with," she shares.</p><p>"Having to go back as a 34 year old and rework your psyche was not fun, but so powerful because the tools that I learned, I could share a tool from that specific time in my life that would help anyone, no matter what they're going through,"&nbsp;the star explains.</p><p>In 2016, Jewel gave fans a look into her life in a memoir titled Never Broken. She revealed then that Carroll was in charge of&nbsp;her finances while managing the "Hands" singer's early career. Despite selling millions of albums in the '90s, Jewel says she fell into serious debt.</p><p>Today, the Grammy-winning artist&nbsp;is the co-founder of an app called <a href=#>Innerworld</a>&nbsp;which helps&nbsp;people struggling with their mental health — especially young entertainers like she was.</p><p>"I was bar singing as an 8-year-old," she recounts. "I was around predators, I had a very scary life. I had a very terrifying life. And I had a life where adults weren't safe people, being in connection to people wasn't safe."</p><p>"I didn't have a safe figure (growing up). But that's also why I formed our youth foundation, is because there's real hope for kids like that," she adds.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>64 Artists Not In the Country Music Hall of Fame</h2><p>Which county singer is most deserving of a Country Music Hall of Fame induction?
