And as for <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Diana</a>'s own eff-you moment, it was everything a royal woman wouldn't have worn to a public event, at the time.</p><p id=eLF13OoDG0W5 data-wc=38>With a ruched, curve-hugging silhouette, an off-the-shoulder plunging neckline and above-knee length, Diana had kept the dress in her wardrobe for years after buying it in 1991, and was said to have thought it too 'risqué' in hindsight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/00f34fdcf848-diana-dress-arrival-z.jpg><p id=eVImQhm5Zgvk data-wc=5><strong>Diana's unforgettable moment in 1994</strong></p><h2><strong>The events that led up to Diana's 'revenge' moment.</strong></h2><p id=eUt2LuVMe4uW data-wc=67>Though we will never really know the truth behind Diana's fashion choices that night, a pretty clear picture emerges from those that were closest to her. Her late fashion stylist and friend, Anna Harvey, told 2013 documentary <strong>Princess Diana's Dresses: The Auction</strong> that having found out about Charles' confession from previews of the interview, she wanted to hold her head high in whatever she wore that night.</p><p id=eBu6G06tPQhH data-wc=54><strong>"She wanted to look a million dollars. And she did,"</strong> she said. Indeed, we know that Diana liked to make a statement with her fashion choices, and there was usually meaning behind each decision. Anna also wrote in a 1997 piece for Vogue: "She rapidly learned how to make an impact... <strong>it thrilled her</strong>."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5390571cfd09-diana-pop-up-shop-white-z.jpg><h6><a aria-label="Princess Diana pop-up shop" class=hm-link href=# rel=affs>SHOP NOW</a></h6><p id=eGon1yh9lvwY data-wc=53>Over the years, Diana had also grown tiresome of designers that used her name for press promotion, according to Anna. And so when Valentino sent out a presumptuous press release confirming she was wearing one of its dresses ahead of the Vanity Fair event, she made a U-turn on her original outfit choice.</p><p id=eJJZnv9DAFx4 data-wc=89>The slinky Christina Stambolian dress, which had been sat in her sizeable walk-in wardrobe for years, was selected instead. Paul Burrell, her former butler, has claimed that he was the one who chose it for her. During Channel 5 documentary <strong>Secrets of the Royal Dressmakers</strong>, he said: "She said, 'I can't go, I can't face the world knowing what Charles has just said. And anyway I haven't got anything to wear.' I went to her wardrobe room and pulled out the Christina Stambolian dress, and showed it to her."</p><p id=ee5pbSKnMjms data-wc=1><strong>SEE: <a class=hm-link href=#>5 of Princess Diana's most show-stopping fashion moments</a></strong></p><p id=ephlKvvtvjyw data-wc=1><strong>PHOTOS: <a class=hm-link href=#>8 times Princess Diana totally nailed it in a little black dress</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d4380a95b145-diana-dress-garden-group-z.jpg><p id=e2ZyOspEmA9K data-wc=8><strong>Princess Diana was the belle of the ball</strong></p><p id=eNgaYLsNJMx4 data-wc=38>He added that Diana had thought she wouldn't fit in the dress anymore, having bought it back in 1991. "I said, 'Try it on.' She slipped into it, I zipped her up and she looked a million dollars."</p><p id=egctcu95qOBr data-wc=61>Another close friend, Dr James Colthurst, has previously said that it was also negative feedback about a speech she had made that pushed her to make a statement. "That day she was mightily fed up because she'd had criticism from what she called the 'Grey Men', I think to do with one of her successful speeches," he told the Daily Mail.</p><p id=eU5WAlvmoS5F data-wc=42>"The day before the Vanity Fair party she was saying, 'Oh for goodness sake, here we go again!' So I told her, 'You’ve got to show defiance; put something on that really swings the heads.' In the end she chose that dress."</p><p id=eyGtekGLSPEs data-wc=1><strong>WATCH: <a class=hm-link href=#>Recreate Princess Diana's iconic blue eyeliner look</a></strong></p><p id=e2yRA1lAtCCl data-wc=1><strong>SEE: <a aria-label="Charles Spencer reveals moving tribute to Princess Diana at Althorp home" class=hm-link href=#>Charles Spencer reveals moving tribute to Princess Diana at Althorp home</a></strong></p><p id=ePU1wHQMuzpj data-wc=74>Dame Julia Peyton-Jones, former director of the <strong>Serpentine Gallery</strong>, recalls that she was informed Princess Diana would be wearing an unexpected dress for the occasion – and that she had sent an RSVP a week before the event. Previews of Prince Charles' damning interview in <strong>Charles: The Private Man, The Public Role</strong>, had been shown to the press days before its release, and rumours were swirling that it was set to cause a stir.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/361257ed221d-diana-dress-movement1-z.jpg><p id=e3HxFm3c0Uqx data-wc=8><strong>The silk and chiffon Stambolian dress drew gasps</strong></p><p id=efvulOzbWrXN data-wc=34>"I was surprised when our Patron's lady-in-waiting told me that she'd be wearing a short dress, not the long one customarily worn at such events.

Diana was one of the most famous and beautiful women in the world... it was as if she'd come down to earth from another planet.

"Diana looked fabulous, of course," he said. "I only had a limited time before everyone sat down for dinner and realised at the last moment that I had not managed to get a picture of Diana with Vanity Fair's editor Graydon Carter who was sponsoring the evening.

Her clutch bag was from one of her go-to designers, <strong>Salvatore Ferragamo</strong> – a modern version of the 'Vara' bow clutch, which she carried that night, is still available to buy today. It is much lesser known than the 'Lady D' bag, or the 'Diana' clutch, a design she had in more than 20 different finishes from the Italian designer. Unlike other members of the royal family, <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Diana</a> was fond of fiery red nail polish</strong>, too, and set off her black cocktail dress just so. Well known for her hosiery, she added a pair of black tights that were just sheer enough.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/833fae13db00-diana-meets-dress-designer-christina-z.jpg><p id=eoYX9gXgU0lC data-wc=6><strong>Diana met Christina Stambolian at Christies</strong></p><p id=eaCkIIpsoVn5 data-wc=70>As for jewellery, Diana's engagement ring was still firmly on her wedding finger. Her statement pearl and sapphire choker, which was once a brooch given to her as a wedding gift from the <a class=hm-link href=#>Queen Mother</a>, was the natural choice for the dress. It was clearly her favourite to wear with strapless and off-shoulder gowns – she also memorably wore it the night she danced with <a class=hm-link href=#>John Travolta</a> at the White House in 1985.</p><p id=e0gEAau7j5Vi data-wc=85>Her earrings aren't often mentioned, though Diana chose failsafe pieces that she had owned before she became Princess of Wales – the <strong>Collingwood Pearl Drop Earrings</strong> – which today are significant favourites of the <a class=hm-link href=#>Duchess of Cambridge</a>, worn for a number of important portraits and appearances. The pearl drop earrings were originally a gift from Collingwood, family jeweller of the Spencer family, following her engagement to Prince Charles. She also added a <strong>diamond and sapphire bracelet</strong>, thought to have been a gift from the <strong>Emir of Qatar</strong>.</p><p id=ezPwvB3eCqQp data-wc=1><strong>SEE: <a aria-label="Kate Middleton's change to Princess Diana's iconic engagement ring has 'no effect' – details" class=hm-link href=#>Kate Middleton's change to Princess Diana's iconic engagement ring has 'no effect' – details</a></strong></p><h2><strong>The mystery of Princess Diana's 'revenge' dress today</strong></h2><p id=eeayjlvVOSIu data-wc=40>In June 1997, just months before her tragic passing, Princess Diana held a charity auction to sell 79 of her most famous dresses in order to raise funds for the <strong>Royal Marsden Hospital Cancer Fund</strong> and the <strong>AIDS Crisis Trust</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4c9e0fb22e1d-dianas-dress-in-auction-catalogue-z.jpg><p id=e8qXfxIE6gfE data-wc=8><strong>The Princess Diana dress auction catalogue July 1997</strong></p><p id=e6Z4SL313c1z data-wc=34>Sweetly, it was a 15-year-old <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince William</a> who had the idea. In the Christies auction catalogue, a handwritten note from Diana reads: <strong>"The inspiration for this wonderful sale comes from just one person... our son William."</strong></p><p id=eHOlMe-IH73q data-wc=93>Amongst the lots, which included countless memorable Catherine Walker designs and the velvet 'Travolta' dress by Victor Edelstein, was the 'revenge' dress. And within the catalogue, which was presumably approved by the Princess, was the description: "The Princess bought this dress off-the-peg for a dinner she attended given by Vanity Fair at The Serpentine Gallery, London, in 1993. The dress caused a great deal of comment at the time and subsequently, not only for its daring asymmetrical ruching, but also because it was thought not to be the work of a British designer."</p><p id=eK6fP_ctGRPL data-wc=15><strong>Are you a Princess Diana fan?

The Christina Stambolian dress was purchased for £39,098 by a Scottish couple, Graeme and Briege Mackenzie, who at the time revealed that they would use it to raise further money for charities, as Diana wished.</p><p id=eJi35DrTtw2sm data-wc=73>"We were lucky enough to meet the Princess at the auction preview in Christie's in London and told her our intentions of using the dress to raise money for charity," Graeme said, according to Mail Online. "At the time charities were complaining that the National Lottery was impacting on their donations. I thought the dress would be a way of attracting people to events and that its fame could only help that aim."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2c02fba869fe-dianas-dress-designer-christina-z.jpg><p id=eU9i0Z6keHS8c data-wc=9><strong>Christina Stambolian at a private viewing of the dress</strong></p><p id=eHRqTh3Y8VtB4 data-wc=67>It's thought that the dress was used on a few occasions at luncheons and functions for the charity Children 1st, though when <strong>HELLO! </strong>reached out to the organisation, a representative couldn't confirm that was the case. The Mackenzies reportedly put the dress into a bank vault following Diana's death. "The only noble thing to do was not to use it," Graeme said. "It would have been inappropriate."</p><p id=eCVHJf6cJr6JV data-wc=57>Little more was said about the dress, other than that new owner Briege wouldn't be wearing the dress herself. She told The Independent in 1997 that the dress is a size 10. "I am not some rich b***h pretending she's a princess by buying one of her dresses to prance around cocktail parties in," she candidly said.</p><p id=e4zyT17SM20HD data-wc=25>"I can't fit into it, but that's not really the idea in this instance.
