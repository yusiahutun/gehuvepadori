The idea was that he and co-stars <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Art Carney</a>, Audrey Meadows and Joyce Randolph would shoot 78 episodes in the first two seasons, with an option for a third season of 39 more. But following that first year, Jackie took the unexpected — and pretty much unprecedented at the time — move to cancel his own show. Believing that those episodes, collectively known now as “The Classic 39,” was as good as the show could be, he decided to return to his variety show format, folding Ralph Kramden, Ed Norton and their wives back into it.</p><p>“Jackie really marched to his own beat,” offers his stepson, Craig Horwich, who serves as the head of Jackie Gleason Enterprises in an exclusive interview. “Jackie saw himself as a man who was built upon his own talents and his own abilities, interests, and passions. His integrity as a man, let alone as an artist, and his integrity as a producer, stands alone in the industry. There are others that were certainly wonderful, but Jackie recognized that The Honeymooners worked because of the definition of their characters. Nowadays, in the 21st Century, we look at TV shows and writers working with their characters, intentionally looking to evolve them. I think with <a title=_self href=#>The Big Bang Theory</a>, Chuck Lorre and his team have acknowledged for years that they’re looking to take these young kids and give them relationships and marriages, and that’s all wonderful. Today’s audience expects that; we have that kind of relationship with our entertainment.”</p><p><strong>Please scroll down for more of our exclusive look at the life and career of Jackie Gleason.</strong></p><p>Be sure to check out and <a href=#>subscribe to our Classic TV & Film Podcast</a> for interviews with your favorite stars!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46jmJyjmZp6qLjEmqqopl2owaa80qilZpuilraoeZBucGxuY2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ai-home-redesign-interiors-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I let AI redesign my home and here's what happened</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./6-k-pop-fans-who-became-stars-debuting-same-agencies.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>6 K-pop fans who became stars, debuting in the same agencies as their idols, from Aespas Winter a</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
