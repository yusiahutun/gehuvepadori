One might be fascinated by his success in music, but what's more insane is the comment section of his Instagram posts.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Brooks'&nbsp;social media has tons of strange and random comments. The singer even did a zoom call Meet n' Greet, where he responded to the unusual and repetitive comments&nbsp;on his Instagram comment section. Here's everything you need to know.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why Are People Asking Garth Brooks Where He Is Hiding the Bodies?</h2><p>If you take a quick look at his Instagram or Twitter, you'll find hundreds of thousands of comments asking the country singer about hiding all the bodies.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>What are they&nbsp;talking about? Is there a conspiracy behind Brooks killing people? <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Well, it all stems back from the press conference that Brooks held where comedians and talk show hosts Tom Segura and Christina Pazsitzky&nbsp;jokingly said he must be a serial killer with 200-300 bodies buried in his yard.&nbsp;</p><p>In his recent podcast clip from <a href=# rel=follow>YourMomsHousePodcast</a>, Segura uncovered how their petty joke during the event caught fire on the internet leading Brooks' comment section hijacked by "hiding the bodies" comments.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why Are People Asking Garth Brooks to Touch Their Camera through the Fence?</h2><p>Another famous branch of comments&nbsp;that one can immediately spot under the singer's comment section is asking him, "TOUCH MY CAMERA THROUGH THE FENCE." This comment, however, has nothing to do with Brooks. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The origin&nbsp;of this comment lies in another <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">video</a> featured on YMH. In September 2019, Segura showcased to the world a person who was&nbsp;better known as Lord Fedsmoker. In the video, Fedsmoker is seen arguing with a private security guard through a fence.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The argument gets heated a few moments in and that's when Fedsmoker utters the words, "you don't touch my camera through the fence." This is where the joke originated and has now made a home within Brooks' Instagram comment sections.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Garth Brooks Responds to the Comments under His Instagram Posts</h2><p>The legendary country singer recently sat down for&nbsp;a Zoom call,&nbsp;"Meet n' Greet," and one enterprising fan asked him questions about all the comments on his social media.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Comedians&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Tom Segura</a> and Christina Pazsitzky, the creators of one of the viral comments under the country singer's Instagram, dissected Brooks' response to his fan's questions on their podcast clip,&nbsp;"<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Garth Brooks Confronted About His Social Media."</a> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"You got a hell of a job cut out if you are trying to make sense out of social media," said Brooks.&nbsp;</p><p>For Segura and Pazsitzky, his reply seemed suspiciously prepared to answer those questions. It looked like someone else had already prepared him a set of concrete answers if someone raised questions about it.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ%2BRp8GpecGrpqijo2KwsLnMnqWtZaOasLW1zqdkoqajqa6ovsCmZaGsnaE%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./instagram-star-diana-strips-naked-18347828.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Instagram star Diana strips NAKED to enjoy nature in all its glory</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./daniel-ezra-dating-girlfriend-samantha-logan-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Daniel Ezra's Dating Speculations- Has a Girlfriend?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
