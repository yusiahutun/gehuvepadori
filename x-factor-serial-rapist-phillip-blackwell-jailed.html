It would appear to be a risk to do this but was happy to take," Adrian Langdale told the court.</p><p>"He ran the risk of being identified outweighed his desire for fame. His offending continued after his two minutes of fame."</p><p>However he continued his attacks after the show, right up until 2019 when he was finally caught.</p><p>The court also heard some of the "delusional terms" he would discuss during his attacks, telling one victim: "If I met a girl like you, I would want to marry you.
