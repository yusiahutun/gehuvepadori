Downey Jr. became an <a href=#>Oscars</a> winner last night for his role as politician Lewis Strauss in Christopher Nolan’s biopic Oppenheimer.</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> starred as Tony Stark (Iron Man) in 10 Marvel Cinematic Universe films between 2008 and 2019, so Oppenheimer was widely referred to as a comeback for the actor as he had taken on only a handful of other projects over the past decade that weren’t MCU-related.</p><p>At the beginning of his speech, Downey Jr. jokingly announced: “I’d like to thank my terrible childhood and the Academy — in that order.”</p><p>When he was growing up, Robert Downey Jr. <a href=# rel=nofollow>reportedly</a> battled heavy addiction problems, had to deal with his parents’ divorce while they each had individual issues.</p><p>At the beginning of the Oscars ceremony, Downey Jr. appeared to look uncomfortable after host Jimmy Kimmel made a joke about his history of substance abuse.</p><p>Continuing the speech, the star then expressed gratitude for his wife: “I’d like to thank my veterinarian — I meant wife, Susan Downey over there. She found me a snarling rescue pet and you loved me back to life. That’s why I’m here.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-think-robert-downey-jr-s-made-a-dig-at-marvel>Fans think Robert Downey Jr.’s made a dig at Marvel</h2><p>While accepting the award, Robert Downey Jr. also said: “Here’s my little secret: I needed this job more than it needed me.”</p><p>Some fans think that this was a coded dig at Marvel.</p><p>Paying tribute to his co-stars, he continued: “Emily, Cillian, Matt… it was fantastic and I stand here before you a better man because of it. You know, what we do is meaningful, and the stuff that we decide to make is important.”</p><p>On social media, some people have speculated that these comments were alluding disparagingly to his work in Marvel. One user suggested that he may have meant he “does not want to go back to Marvel”, and others wondered whether he “was fed up of Marvel capes.”</p><p>Wrapping up his speech, Downey Jr. thanked: “My entertainment lawyer Tom Hanson, of 40 years, the half of which he spent trying to get me insured and bailing me out of the hoosegow — thanks, bro.”</p><p>The Oppenheimer star also made sure to thank his stylist, publicist and manager when accepting his award.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2Z%2BcL7Om5yrrF2ZvLi6xLJko6qjYry0r8CrqmaroJqypLSMrZ%2BappuasW6x1Z6psqeemnqqusKlrJ2hnpx6qbXSZqueqqKer62xjJyfoqSUnbywsI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sites-find-anything-shown-movies-tv-shows.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 7 Best Sites to Find Items and Clothes in Movies and TV Shows</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./queen-rania-of-jordan-husband-king-of-jordan-emergency-spinal-surgery.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Queen Rania's husband, the King of Jordan, recovering after emergency spinal surgery</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
