There’s no such thing as another you and this is your greatest superpower. If you’re wondering <a href=#>how the full moon in Leo will </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>affect</a><a href=#> each zodiac sign</a>, stay true to your heart’s desires, as it will emphasize the need for love and self-expression. Whether personally or professionally, this lunation encourages you to open your heart so you can experience more joy, creativity, and passion in your life. It’s time to take the lead, even if that means ruffling some feathers along the way!</p><p>Leo’s archetype is all about authenticity, courage, fertility, and the inner child. Its fixed fire represents the innate ability to secure and stabilize the eternal flame of creation, which goes hand in hand with Leo’s love for <a href=#>artistry, performance, </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and</a><a href=#> celebration</a>. Spreading joy, cheer, and inspiration is part of its celestial mission, and believe it or not, the astrological house that belongs to Leo in your chart is the area of life where you shine the brightest. It is, after all, ruled by none other than the sun—our greatest source of energy—so consider this an opportunity to put your talents on display and bask in the spotlight.</p><p>With the sun in Aquarius, let alone in close proximity to powerhouse Pluto, which is <a href=#>the </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>planet</a><a href=#> of destruction</a>, transformation, rebirth, and everything hidden beneath the surface. This full moon has a shadowy component to it despite it happening in the vibrant sign of Leo. The astrological axis of Leo and Aquarius reminds us that there’s no such thing as an individual (Leo) without a community (Aquarius), and vice versa. Aquarius rules everything from your community affairs to your visions of the future, but <a href=#>with Pluto</a><a href=#>in Aquarius</a>, something taboo-like could be illuminated in the process.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-30.png><p>The first full moon of the year will reach its peak via 5 degrees of Leo on January 25 at 12:54 p.m. ET. As always, be sure to look back to the new moon in Leo that took place in August 2023 for reference on this full-circle moment. Moreover, when considering Pluto’s recent ingress into Aquarius, reflect back to March through June 2023, as this was a mini prelude to Pluto’s journey through this fixed air sign. Consider the transformation you’re experiencing within your social networks and how your role within the community is changing.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1><p>The full moon in Leo takes place on January 25 at 12:54 p.m. ET.</p></figure><p>This full moon will square off <a href=#>with </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Jupiter</a><a href=#> in Taurus</a>—with its ruler, Venus, now in the pragmatic sign of Capricorn—bringing awareness to your sense of self-worth and core value systems, specifically when considering your contributions to the world at large. Venus will also harmonize <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with Saturn in Pisces</a>, highlighting what needs more structure and boundaries in order for you to see the results you crave.

If you’re not exploring a new hobby or form of self-expression, you’re probably looking forward to kicking back and having fun. With the moon charging up your fifth house of love, passion projects, and recognition, you’re being called to lead with your heart and remain true to your authenticity. If you find yourself suddenly questioning the foundation of a friendship or social clique, don’t disregard what’s being brought to your attention. The same goes for your professional goals and endeavors. Prioritize your values, and trust your intuition. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.3136690647482><h2>Taurus</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zodiacbanner_taurus.png><p>There is a greater emphasis on the home you’ve created, if not the one you’re in the process of creating, Taurus. And with the full moon touching down on your fourth house of family, feelings, home, and hearth, Luna is highlighting everything from your emotional foundations to the dynamic of your early upbringing. If you’re feeling hesitant about taking the lead in your personal life and doing what brings you joy, consider whether this is coming from a place of integrity or pride. The sun and Pluto are uncovering hidden truths within your home base, which may reflect matters of reputation.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.8926553672316><h2>Gemini</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zodiacbanner_gemini.png><p>You can never be too inquisitive or insightful, Gemini. But when considering January’s full moon hovering over your third house of communication and immediate surroundings, the conversations you’d normally have on a regular day are bound to escalate. It also doesn’t help that chatty Mercury is conjunct hot-headed Mars, but instead of keeping to yourself or communicating with caution, this lunation is urging you to speak up. More importantly, the influence of the sun and Pluto in Aquarius is bringing awareness to the shadow side of your belief systems and worldviews.

Activating your second house of comfort, finances, and values, the full moon is bringing emphasis to everything from your spending habits to your money-making abilities. This is a time to consider if your investments hold true value and whether they’re in alignment with your future visions. If you’ve been overindulging in an online shopping addiction or unconsciously comparing yourself with the people you follow on social media, the sun-Pluto in Aquarius makes your little secret all the more difficult to ignore. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.3168316831683><h2>Leo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zodiacbanner_leo.png><p>This is your very own full moon glow-up, so make it count, Leo! Despite feeling as comfortable as ever under the spotlight, this lunation marks a period of celebration, completion, and emotional culmination. Make a toast to your authenticity, courage, and sheer willpower because your personal and professional accomplishments are worth celebrating. Lucky Jupiter is bringing expansion and opportunity to your professional life, but the influence of Pluto in Aquarius could explain why you’re suddenly questioning your role in a particular community.

This is especially significant to consider with the full moon charging up your 12th house of secrets, surrender, hidden agendas, and patterns of self-sabotage. If you’ve been unconsciously neglecting your inner child or perhaps contributing energy that isn’t being reciprocated, the days when you sacrificed your happiness for the sake of another are numbered.

Not that you need an excuse to celebrate your recent achievements, but this lunation encourages you to acknowledge how far you’ve come since you started. Important decisions are put on the table with Mercury and Mars in Capricorn, specifically regarding your role within a professional network.
