Yeah, that one: “One Kiss” was also written by “<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Figures</a>” singer and all around badass, Jessie Reyez.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2>“Party in the U.S.A.” – Miley Cyrus</h2><p>Before there was hammer-licking Miley Cyrus or country-crooning Miley, there was post-Disney Miley. Among the Hannah Montana star’s immediate hits was “Party in the U.S.A.”—which some might be surprised to learn was written by British pop star,&nbsp;Jessie J. (Could a “Party in the U.K.” be in the pipeline?)</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2>“Breakaway” – Kelly Clarkson</h2><p>If you were around in the early 2000s, you probably heard Kelly Clarkson sing “Breakaway” about a bajillion times on the radio. While we’re still not tired of the classic pop-rock bop, we’re pleased to inform you that the song was actually written by another early 2000s pop-rock princess, Avril Lavigne.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2>“Little Things” – One Direction</h2><p>Before the members of One Direction went off on their own, the group actually collabbed with another famous British pop act for their ballad, “Little Things.” Well, that collaborator was none other than singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran, who wrote the sweet track the boys serenaded millions of girls with. (The world thanks you, Ed.)</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2>“Forget You” – CeeLo</h2><p>CeeLo can thank Bruno Mars for the insanely catchy lyrics of “Forget You,” as well as its NSFW version, “Fuck You.” (Who knew Bruno Mars had such a potty mouth.)</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2>“Till the World Ends” – Britney Spears</h2><p>Fans might be surprised to know that Kesha is a secret hitmaker. Along with writing songs for pop stars like Miley Cyrus and <a href=# id=auto-tag_ariana-grande data-tag=ariana-grande>Ariana Grande</a>, the singer is also creditted for composing&nbsp;Britney Spears’ &nbsp;“Till the World Ends,” which she actually made with the pop princess in mind.</p><p>“That song was written specifically for Britney,” Kesha told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Spy</a>. “I put my brain in Britney Spears land and wrote that whole song for her.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2>“Black Widow” – Iggy Azalea & Rita Ora</h2><p>Katy Perry is known for cranking out her own pop hits (just look at how many No. 1 hits she has), but for Iggy Azalea and Rita Ora, the pop star stepped away from the microphone and wrote the up-and-comers (at the time) a song—and thus, “Black Widow” was born. (Fun fact: Perry was considering the track for her own album, Prism, but decided against it last minute.)</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2>“Irreplaceable” – Beyoncé</h2><p>Ne-Yo had the honor of writing one of Beyoncé’s first hits, “Irreplaceable,” off her second solo album, B’Day. Initially, the R&B singer wrote the track with a country singer in mind, but once Queen Bey heard a demo, she knew she wanted it—and, of course, she elevated it to No. 1 because that’s just how Bey rolls.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2>“A Little Bit of Your Heart” – Ariana Grande</h2><p>With a voice like Ariana Grande’s, the singer has some power ballads in her repertoire. Among them is the sweet track, “A Little bit of Your Heart,” which is actually written by one of our fave curly-haired boybanders, Harry Styles. (Are you shook yet?)</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2>“Disturbia” – Rihanna</h2><p>Initially intending to record the song for himself, Chris Brown eventually gave it to his then-girlfriend, Rihanna. Though the relationship fizzled through for reasons we all know about, “Disturbia” eventually became one of Rih’s many hits to come.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2>“Flash Light” – Hailee Steinfeld</h2><p>Here’s a secret for you “Pitch Perfect” fans: the iconic song Hailee Steinfeld sings in Pitch Perfect 2 was actually written by smash vocalists, Sam Smith and Sia. Yup. “Flashlight,” which was sung on the soundtrack by Jessie J, has some of the most respected names in the biz as its songwriters. Plus, it sounds damn good a cappella.</p><p>A version of this article was originally published in June 2017.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ilpai2pHuVcWlrb2NkwLC6xqxksKqZqcGmuoybsGanpJ2ys3nSoqWgnaKofA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lizzo-stars-in-instacart-campaign-with-cameo-from-mom-somebody-get-this-girl-reality-show.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lizzo Stars in New Instacart Campaign With a Cameo From Her Mom</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./enable-god-mode-in-windows-10.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Is the &amp;quot;God Mode&amp;quot; Folder in Windows 10, and How Do I Enable It?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
