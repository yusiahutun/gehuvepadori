Here’s all we know about her and her turbulent relationship with her mother.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Sherilyn and her late father, Eddie Guerrero, were reportedly close and happy until his untimely death. One would expect her only remaining parent, Vicky Guerrero, to have a strong bond with her, but sadly, that is not the case.&nbsp;</p><p>Vicky and Sherilyn have had a rocky relationship filled with ups and downs. Sherilyn has even publicly called her mother out, making fans wonder how it all went wrong. Keep reading to discover everything we know about Sherilyn Amber Guerrero and her life behind the curtains.&nbsp;</p><p>This article contains a trigger word: Sexual Assault.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Eddie_Guerreros_Daughter_Sherilyn_Amber_Guerrero></span>Who Is Eddie Guerrero’s Daughter, Sherilyn Amber Guerrero?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sherilyn Amber Guerrero is the celebrity daughter of late <a href=#>WWE</a> legend Eddie Guerrero and his wife, Vickie Guerrero. Sherilyn’s mother, Vickie, is also a famous WWE superstar who majorly performed as a ringside manager and announcer.&nbsp;</p><p>Sherilyn came into the world on July 8, 1995, and is 28 years old as of 2023. Her elder sister, Shaul Guerrero, is also in the <a href=#>WWE</a> like their parents were. Shaul is also a model, commentator, and wrestling vale.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/118890107_1655378541292181_3670068824642346144_n.png><p>The sisters have a close bond, and Shaul occasionally posts about her sister on her Instagram page. They often attend events and go out together, looking happy in their photos.</p><p>Sherilyn has a solid educational background, which only got better with time. She studied at the EL Paso Gridley High School when she was much younger. After graduating high school, the celebrity kid furthered her education by enrolling at a reputable university.</p><p>The university’s name has been kept under wraps, and information about her degree is also undisclosed.&nbsp;Sherilyn was close to her father and significantly affected by his death. Eddie passed away after a severe illness on November 13, 2005, and life was never the same for the family.</p><p>He was only 39 when he died, which shook the entertainment industry.&nbsp;To date, Sherilyn goes to her father’s grave site, prays for him, and spends quality time reminiscing on their memories together.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sherilyn_Amber_Guerreros_Interests_and_Career></span>Sherilyn Amber Guerrero’s Interests and Career&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Unlike all her other family members, Sherilyn did not choose a career in the wrestling world. From a young age, she preferred watching the sport to participating.&nbsp;</p><p>She tried and practiced with her sister occasionally but did not improve with time because her heart was not in it. Sherilyn always preferred the art world and aspired to be a model or a photographer.&nbsp;</p><p>She has achieved a stable career in both professions over the years. Many assume that her university degree is linked to her passion for photography and modeling, but this can only be confirmed true once she speaks about it.&nbsp;</p><p>She showcases her talent via her Instagram page and reportedly charges $50 per hour for her studio sessions. Her career has successfully earned her a net worth estimated at $100,000 as of 2023.</p><p>Sherilyn is also a lover of music and can sing well. She is an adorable dog mom and a strong lover of animals, too. She resides in Texas with her dog and boyfriend in an undisclosed location.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Eddie_Guerrero_and_Vickies_Relationship></span>Eddie Guerrero and Vickie’s Relationship&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#>Eddie</a> and Vickie were a power couple and a force to reckon with while he was alive. She was his ringside announcer and cheered him up during his matches.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/109778744_10158686774617422_2502948938608007568_n-873x1024.jpg><p>His death greatly affected her as they had two beautiful children and had been married for a long time. Before Vickie retired, she constantly mentioned Eddie on air, keeping his legacy alive for the new and old generations of the WWE Universe.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Vickie_Guerrero_and_Her_Daughters_Estranged_Relationship></span>Vickie Guerrero and Her Daughter’s Estranged Relationship&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Years after Eddie died, Vickie remarried, giving her children a stepfather figure while they were growing up. Things seemed to be going well until sometime in April 2023, when Sherilyn made a TikTok <a href=#>accusing her stepfather</a> of sexual assault and harassment while they were on a cruise in 2020.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/281427_165724440163824_7479675_n.jpg><p>The video quickly went viral, and fans were concerned about the situation. Sherilyn claimed she was making the video because she had received messages and inquiries about her cutting her mother off, as they were not seen publicly.&nbsp;</p><p>She explained in the video that she did not cut Vickie off but was not on excellent terms with her either. She said that Vickie decided to trust her husband over her when she recounted the assault to her. This, in turn, put a significant strain on their relationship, and they have not been on speaking terms ever since.&nbsp;</p><p>Vickie has not publicly acknowledged these allegations nor said anything about her husband’s guilt or innocence.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kwKmx0aKjsqZdlrqjsdFmnq6doqeys7uMppyerF2asaW1xGaYp5xdq7akt9hmnq6doqeys7vSZpysrKKWu6ixw2abmq2XncGmvo4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hibachi-grill-for-home-indoor-built-in-155600.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Best Hibachi Grills for Home Use You Can Buy on Amazon</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./reggie-bush-bombshell-wife-lilit-pose-sweet-selfies-adorable-children-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Reggie Bush and his bombshell wife Lilit pose for sweet selfies with their adorable children</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
