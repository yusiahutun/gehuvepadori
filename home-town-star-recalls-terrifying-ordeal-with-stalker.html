He was accused of pulling a firearm and a “taser” after a verbal altercation and the&nbsp; accuser reported “serious verbal threats” to harm him, just a month before visiting Laurel. He was wearing an ankle monitor when he was out and about in Laurel.</p><p>Gaffney was saying strange things such as, “God sent me here to protect the women of Laurel, specifically little Helen,” Napier wrote.</p><p>“He had bought a house a block from ours and was living in it with nothing but a suitcase and these toys for when my 3-year-old daughter, ‘comes over to visit,’ Napier wrote. “Ben saw red, his blood boiled.”</p><p>Gaffney had dolls named after the Napiers’ children, reports indicated, and, at the time, Napier was "terrified and 9.5 months pregnant” at the time. In the two weeks that followed, Gaffney found Mallory and Jim Rasberry’s baby girl on walks with her nanny and said unsettling things, Napier wrote.</p><p>“We all had 24-hour security officers at home, while we slept, while we worked,” she continued. “Helen asked who they were and why they were here, and we never told her the truth. ‘They work with us! They’re friends of ours who are staying with us for a little while!’”</p><p>A year later, Napier wrote that she still thinks of the incident every day, but it doesn’t scare her anymore.</p><p>“I’m thankful for the way our neighborhood guarded us and put up a hedge of protection when we needed it and further validated what I already knew: Protect your kids in the online world as much as you can,” Napier</p><p>wrote.</p><p>The Leader-Call reported last May that the stars of “Home Town” filed a restraining order against Gaffney for making “disturbing comments” about their children, and the “May The Fourth” man was forced to leave Laurel after his bond was revoked in California for violating the terms of his release on the felony charges there.</p><p>When Gaffney made his way to Laurel, he sent out brochures offering a $1,000 reward for anyone who could help him find a home for sale in the historic district so he could get Ben and Erin Napier to renovate it for him. His Facebook page shows that he is a real-estate broker in Santa Barbara.</p><figure class="photo layout-horizontal letterbox-style-default"><a href=# class=tnt-asset-link aria-label="‘Luke Skystalker’ back in Cali"></a></figure><h3 class=tnt-headline><a href=# class=tnt-asset-link aria-label="‘Luke Skystalker’ back in Cali">‘Luke Skystalker’ back in Cali</a></h3><p class=tnt-summary>Star-obsessed man made ‘disturbing comments’ about children, restraining order filed</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcLTOppxmrJ%2Bsu26%2F05qpZqqVmK6tuNJmq56qop6zurXNoGSoqpSarq151qKroWWjqa6tt8SrZpqqpJ6wrbG%2BnGqdcZaXf3d5wp%2BanWVhZrKkeZecaGtllmywdITDcZlrbZWYe6nAzKU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./article-d95b91f8-fa42-11ed-b060-7bdc38ae1f33-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jones College spring honor rolls | JC News</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hailey-baldwin-justin-bieber-phone.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hailey Baldwin Confesses to Snooping on Justin Bieber's Phone</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
