SEBRING will be required to perform satisfactorily in a stalls test.</p><p>From the outside barrier, XIANG BAI QI was shifted across behind runners in the early stages.</p><p>Passing the 1200 Metres, TIANCHI MONSTER was steadied away from the heels of KIRAM (G van Niekerk) which shifted in when not properly clear.</p><p>G van Niekerk was reprimanded.</p><p>After the 1200 Metres, PING HAI TREASURE was left racing wide and without cover.</p><p>Shortly after entering the Straight, WILLIE WAY was shifted to the inside of NEW ELEGANCE as that horse was directed to the outside of TRAVEL FIRST after being awkwardly placed close to the heels of that horse.</p><p>TIANCHI MONSTER was held up for clear running approaching and passing the 400 Metres and then had difficulty obtaining clear running between PING HAI TREASURE and RULE THEE approaching and passing the 300 Metres.</p><p>Approaching the 300 Metres, KIRAM momentarily raced in restricted room between NEW ELEGANCE and PING HAI TREASURE.</p><p>KIRAM was then shifted to the outside of PING HAI TREASURE near the 250 Metres.</p><p>Passing the 300 Metres, TRAVEL FIRST and NEW ELEGANCE bumped and became unbalanced as NEW ELEGANCE improved into running between TRAVEL FIRST and SUNNY POWER which shifted out.</p><p>When SUNNY POWER was shifted out, PING HAI TREASURE, which was laying in, was momentarily steadied away from the heels of that horse.</p><p>Approaching the 200 Metres, TIANCHI MONSTER was awkwardly placed inside RULE THEE when taken in by that horse.</p><p>TIANCHI MONSTER was then checked when crowded for room between RULE THEE and SUNNY POWER (C Y Ho) which shifted out abruptly before being corrected by its rider.</p><p>XIANG BAI QI, which was racing to the outside of TIANCHI MONSTER, was hampered in consequence as that horse shifted out.</p><p>As the Stewards were satisfied that C Y Ho had reacted in a timely manner to SUNNY POWER shifting out, no further action was taken.</p><p>A veterinary inspection of TRAVEL FIRST immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.</p><p>NEW ELEGANCE, DANCES WITH DRAGON and HAPPY SEBRING were sent for sampling.</p><p class=postsid
