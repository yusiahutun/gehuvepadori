The actress (who’s also a director, a sometime musician, and a former dancer) shares her famous younger sibling’s elfin features and bohemian New York City background. But while Timothée is off exploring the deserts of Arrakis, Pauline’s new project is a lot closer to home: She stars in Mindy Kaling’s new HBO Max comedy, The Sex Lives of College Girls.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Chalamet plays Kimberly Finkle, a rule-following valedictorian whose high school experience in small-town Arizona has not remotely prepared her for life at fancy Essex College; her performance is funny, frank, and instantly winning. You can practically see the gears in Kimberly’s head spinning as she tries to adjust to life at a prestigious college, with all its new people (many jokes are made about the lack of diversity in her hometown), socioeconomic unfairness (she has a work-study job, unlike most of her classmates), and confusingly hot guys. As Chalamet puts it, The Sex Lives of College Girls isn’t about just sex—it’s about everything that happens before, after, and because of it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Chalamet has worked on short films and TV in the United States and France (her father is French), and she had a part in Judd Apatow’s The King of Staten Island, but this is her first major Hollywood role. Below, she talks to BAZAAR.com about everything from America’s obsession with sex to the French concept of time to her own arts-infused childhood in New York City.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What drew you to the role of Kimberly?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong></strong>I thought it was a very well-written pilot; there were so many funny elements in it. When I read the script, I was like, “I hope they’re asking me to read for Kimberly.” There were so many in-between moments to explore with her.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What do you mean by “in between”?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Well, there’s what she says and what she’s reacting to, but in between that, there’s all the interior monologues that are happening.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Yeah, you can tell that she’s learning and changing very quickly—that she’s coming from this sort of sheltered place and that every encounter she has, she’s growing and becoming less naive. Was that fun for you as an actor?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It really was! It was fun to go back and explore what it was like to be a freshman in college again, but through the eyes of Kimberly who feels out of place socially and economically, in a structure that’s so new for her.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>You went to Bard, right?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I did.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Did it feel like Essex?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s a very small school and it’s not a university, but it certainly is a private institution like Essex. And I definitely was able to relate to feeling out of place, especially economically. You know, you’re not really close to the people you first meet at college. You’re living together, so you kind of become close very quickly, but not close in your heart. You’re not letting them in on your insecurities. So that felt very, very familiar: feeling like you need to fit in, but then also knowing that you don’t.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>The show has an almost all-female writers’ room, and it’s devoted to talking about all sorts of experiences of female sexuality. Do you think there’s a gap that it’s trying to fill?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Well, the United States has these Puritan origins, and we have a sex fetish, right? There’s just something about women and sex. I think the show is very of its time. It’s depicting these four young women who are navigating college, and there’s sex, but what happens before sex and after sex is a big part of it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For so long, shows that deal with sexuality—especially female sexuality—have been about what happens under the sheets. So if there’s a gap the show is trying to fill, it’s being about more than that. It’s about the texts that come before, it’s the behavior of both partners (or more) after, it’s the moment of intimacy. We’re not naked in every scene, but so much of what’s going on is a mirror of the society in which we live, which is a sex-obsessed society. Even though we tried to pretend it’s not. [Laughs.]</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>The name of the show feels prurient in a way, like, </strong><strong>Ooooh, sexy college girls.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I read the title and I’m like, “Oh, my God. It’s about banging girls who just have amazing sex. They’re having orgasms left and right. They have all these different partners and they’re exploring everything.” But I don’t know anyone—or very few people—who at that age were able to do that. Most people I knew were like, “What do I do? Am I straight? What else is out there? Do I even like sex??” It’s like, “Who even likes sex in the beginning? And why are we always being sold this image of people who know exactly what they want?” I think that’s part of what we’re trying to answer.</p><img alt="actor pauline chalamet wears a maroon silk going out top with a tie and gold drop earrings in a still from her hbo max show" title="Pauline Chalamet as Kimberly Finkle in ﻿The Sex Lives of College Girls" width=1000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pauline-chalamet-sq-1636387128.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jessica Brooks</span><p>Pauline Chalamet as Kimberly Finkle in The Sex Lives of College Girls.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>You’ve done all sorts of different kinds of creative work: You’ve directed, you’ve acted, you were a dancer growing up. Do you have a favorite?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I want to continue with all of them. I mean, not so much the dancing—the dancing was really put to bed, but right now, I want to focus on acting. The way I came to it was very roundabout. I was exploring all these different things; I had so many odd jobs. And then I came back full circle, like, “No, I want to be in the arts.”</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What was your weirdest odd job?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I was a copy editor. I loved it. I love grammar. I’m obsessed. I was a bartender. I worked in a cafe. I was a dog walker. I was a babysitter. I was a tutor. Once I was asked to half-babysit, half-bartend. The parents were like, “Set up all the alcohol there on that table, you can bartend, but also watch these eight kids running around.”</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>You’re bilingual in French, right? Do you feel like you’ve been influenced—as an artist or a person—by having a French side?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yeah, I’m bilingual. I spent a little bit of my childhood in France, and I wanted to get back there. I like the structure of French society. I feel very comfortable living in this society that has a lot of rules. Like how you have to set the table before you eat, or the dynamics of who you’re inviting over to your home, the way you greet people. You kind of know how to act. There’s less room for awkwardness.</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What was it like growing up in New York in such a creative family?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Well, I grew up in Hell’s Kitchen, right next to Times Square, in a subsidized arts building. It was kooky as all hell, but it was my home. You know, when you’re a child, it all feels normal. And then, you leave and you realize how different it is. It was like growing up in a musical. You’d walk into an elevator and somebody would be on their way to an audition and they’d be practicing scales. So it made the idea of pursuing a career in the arts feel normal to me, and for that, I’m really grateful.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>When did you realize that this was an unusual childhood?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Probably when I brought a friend home from college. We were waiting for the elevator, and these two people were standing in two different elevators, and as the elevator doors were closing, they were singing a duet. And my friend was like, “What?”</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Tell me about the indie movie you made, </strong><strong>What Doesn’t Float</strong><strong>.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s in post-production. Currently, as we speak, there is a live mini orchestra that’s recording the score for it. What Doesn't Float is really a labor of love. We’re all friends from high school, and we’ve all worked on each other’s short films, and then we were like, “Let’s make a feature.” Basically, it’s seven vignettes about different New Yorkers as they enter into conflict in different worlds of New York. I’m really proud of what it’s going to be.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGiemaG6bsDVaJhscGFthXp%2Flminmq2cnrumecKhmKWZnZrBbsDHnmSsnahiuarCxKxkqJ5dmLytuMSgnGafmae5tHnIp6ueqqaesrh7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./50-facts-about-the-movie-seven-psychopaths.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>50 Facts about the movie Seven Psychopaths</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./article-8ec97280-e1a8-11ec-b4c4-371162c98f53-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Marion Bruce Morgan | Obituaries</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
