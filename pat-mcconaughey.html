Similar is the case with Pat McConaughey, who rose to stardom as a brother of famous actors. So, today’s article is about Pat, brother of <strong>Matthew</strong> <strong>McConaughey </strong>and <strong>Rooster McConaughey</strong>.</p><p>Pat might have earned a great fortune from his successful career. Please read this article to know more about his net worth and personal life.</p><h2>Adopted by McConaughey Family</h2><p>Pat McConaughey was born in 1962 in Houston, Texas, the United States. Moreover, he is adopted, the son of <strong>James Donald McConaughey</strong>, owner of a gas station and ran the business of oil piping, and <strong>Mary Kathlene McCabe</strong>, a&nbsp; teacher. He has two siblings, including <strong>Matthew</strong> <strong>McConaughey</strong>, the biological child of James and Marry, and <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Rooster McConaughey</strong></a>, who his parents also adopt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allstarbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Pat-300x211-1.jpg><p>Moreover, there is no clue about his education and graduation. Pat’s brother, Matthew, is an American actor and producer. He won the best actor award in Oscar for the drama&nbsp;Dallas Buyers Club in 2013. He starred in movies along with<a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal><strong> Jennifer Garner</strong></a> and Jared Leto.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.allstarbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/patt2-1.jpg><p>However, his older brother, Rooster, is a businessman and actor. He earned his father’s business by trading oil pipes and inventories for the oil field. Moreover, his father passed away on 17th August 1992&nbsp;in Fort Bend County, Texas, United States.</p><h2>What Is The Relationship Status Of Pat McConaughey?</h2><p>Pat’s well-wishers and fans wonder if the Houston native is a married man or not. Tall, handsome Pat is a professional man who likes to live a low-key life. There is no information about his spouse and children. He might have secretly married, but the star is yet to reveal his marital status in the media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.allstarbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/with-mother-and-brother-1.jpg><p>However, both his brothers are married and enjoying parenthood with their children. Moreover, we can guess he lives happily with his brother’s family and mother in Texas, USA.

He gained this whopping amount from his career as an actor and businessman. While we can imagine he is living a luxurious life with his brothers and mother.</p><h2>More About his famous brother</h2><p>Unlike Mr. McConaughey, his brother is a bit of a famous personality who is used to being in the limelight. Currently, he is one of the biggest stars in Hollywood. He has starred in many famous movies like Interstellar, Wolf of&nbsp; Wall Street, Sing and Sing 2, and more famous films.</p><p>The outstanding actor also won an oscar for his brilliant acting in Interstellar and is widely known for his out-of-the-box thinking and character-improvising in his acting.</p><p><strong>For more content on your favorite actors, stick with&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>ALLSTARBIO</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHAta3Rm6CoZpOkunC8wK1kppuTpLuiwcahnLJn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-voice-season-6-blind-auditions.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Voice Season 6 Blind Auditions</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./magdalene-st-michaels-actress-age-height-weight-wiki-biography-boyfriend-videos-photos-and-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Magdalene St Michaels (Actress) Age, Height, Weight, Wiki, Biography, Boyfriend, Videos, Photos and</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
