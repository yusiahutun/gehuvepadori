After all those years together on television, the 7th Heaven cast has stayed close over the years.</p><p>That's4Entertainment had some fun with their appearances, too, airing a "very special" scene from the convention floor. Okay, they actually dubbed it "the most unhinged episode ever," but we're calling it like we see it.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>The '90s were known for they're schmaltzy "message" episodes, and this definitely qualifies as Annie reveals to her kids, "I've smoked pot." Their shocked reactions prove that this is about to be a teachable moment about the dangers of drugs and resisting peer pressure. The thinly-veiled PSA is alive and well in Hartford this weekend!</p><p>It almost didn't happen, though, as both Mitchell and Gallagher wound up on the same flight -- and that flight started having troubles. Mitchel jumped on her <a href=#><strong>Instagram</strong></a> on Thursday to let their fans know the TV siblings were together, but not sure they'd make it in time.</p><p>"We're going to make it, but it might come down to planes, trains and automobiles," she quipped, as Gallagher tried to stay optimistic. Ultimately, though, they didn't make it all the way there. In an <a href=#><strong>update</strong></a>, Mitchell and Gallagher shared that they'd only made it as far as Washington, DC.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:811f8306-a237-4aa3-a946-ff34005539a0 data-container-ref=toofab:article:f6abe8a8-d2c2-444b-9f22-0aee6e8b2e8c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/75/5by4/2024/03/13/759cf77ec65a4d819b14e77d455d66b9_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">X/TooFab</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Teen Mom Stars React to Tyler Baltierra's OnlyFans: 'Definitely Not a Subscriber!'

Instead, they opted for five hours of sleep and an early flight, with the duo obviously successful in making it for the weekend's festivities.</p><p>Stephen Collins, who played patriarch Eric, was not present. He's been largely disconnected from the cast since a 2012 therapy session was recorded without his knowledge in which he confessed to molesting underage girls. He came clean in an interview two years later with Katie Couric, saying he'd been dealing with these issues privately.</p><p>7th Heaven followed the sprawling Camden family from 1996 to 2007 across 243 episodes and two networks (The WB became The CW after a merger with UPN in 2006). Collins portrayed a minister trying to successfully raise seven kids with his wife Annie. It was the most-watched series ever on The WB.</p><a id=gallery-link-180de3cc-b9d5-4696-a3b4-b500bbb0267f class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:180de3cc-b9d5-4696-a3b4-b500bbb0267f data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:f6abe8a8-d2c2-444b-9f22-0aee6e8b2e8c data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/50/4by3/2024/01/08/508f6f72474e4c359eb3e0ad9d564750_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2xmam9fbMGpeceemK%2BdnmKwor%2FTZqmerZ6ewaa%2FjHJnrGWTpLtutM6wZJqao5q7tXnJnqqsoZOWeqO1xKVkq52TpLuvscKtZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rick-ross-and-india-westbrook.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rick Ross and India Westbrook</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./5-things-you-didnt-know-about-actress-rhea-perlman.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>5 Things You Didnt Know About Actress Rhea Perlman</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
