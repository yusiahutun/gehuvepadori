She started dating rapper T.I. Cottle, and the pair got married on July 30, 2010.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In the last two decades, the pair has been blessed with&nbsp;two sons, <a href=# rel=follow>King</a> and Major Philant, and a daughter, Heiress Diana. Before Cottle, Harris was in a relationship with Zonnie Pullins.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She shares a daughter named <a href=# rel=follow>Zonnique Pullins</a> with him. Zonnique has a special bond with her mother and has followed in her mother's footsteps in many ways.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>For example, she also underwent eye surgery to change the color of her eyes, as her mother did.&nbsp;</p><h2>Tiny Harris' Eye Surgery&nbsp;</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Harris permanently changed the colors of her eyes in 2014. She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared the news via Instagram</a>, where she posted a picture of herself flaunting her new ice-gray irises.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In the captions, the singer penned that she changed her eyes color with BrightOcular&nbsp;and thanked her doctors for making her "dream come true." She got it because she hated wearing contacts for color since it made her vision blurry.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She admitted that there were risks associated with eye surgeries, but there had been no risks from the procedure she had done. She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared her story with People</a> after getting the procedure. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Harris had heard about changing one's eye color permanently via surgery, through her friend around 2012. They researched about it, but the singer was nervous about doing it.</p><p>Two years later, the topic came up again, and Harris talked to people who had the eye surgery done. She also consulted doctors and found out it simply took 15 minutes to finish the procedure, which was "simple, painless and completely safe." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Moreover, the surgery was reversible, which was the selling point for the singer. The implant used would cover the natural eye color and hence give a new one. For Harris, she covered her&nbsp;brown irises&nbsp;to ice-gray.</p><p>The singer explained her procedures to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ABC News</a>. The surgery started&nbsp;by going into the eye and making a tiny slot to slide the implants in. Next, the&nbsp;implants were folded before sliding them inside the eye and spreading it over.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Harris only got a slight headache after the procedure, but there were no other side effects. However, it cost her around $10,000 for the whole process. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>When asked about what Cottle thought about it, Harris said he was concerned. But when she told him about all the research she had done, the rapper was okay with her getting the surgery.&nbsp;</p><h2>Zonnique Pullins'&nbsp;Eye Surgery</h2><p>Pullins also got the same eye surgery as her mother, but she regretted her decision. This was because a doctor told her she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">could possibly go blind</a> because of the implants.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>She changed the color of her eyes to greyish/blue from dark brown but later realized it was not the best "in the long term." She revealed this while replying to a comment from her fan on Instagram.</p><p>The fan asked if the color change was worth it since they thought of having the procedure done in Kenya. Pullins replied to the comment, saying she had her eye surgery in Tunisia and would not recommend it.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She said that "the experience wasn't the best in the long term but everyone is different." She also talked about getting her surgery reversed in an episode of T.I. & Tiny: Family & Friends Hustle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyZo8ZutMCrqaKrXZrGpnnSrqmgnaKue6nAzKU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./teenager-kidnapped-tied-raped-germany-black-forest-man-met-holiday-abroad-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Teenager is kidnapped, tied up and repeatedly raped for days in Germany's Black Forest 'by man she m</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-royal-hats-in-history.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>70 Best Royal Hats in History</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
