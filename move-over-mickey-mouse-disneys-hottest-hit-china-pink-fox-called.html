In one video that went viral online, a man who failed to get his hands on the blue-eyed, tartan-skirt-wearing stuffed animal broke down on his knees and yelled that he had blood in his urine for standing too long.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shanghai Disney Resort, the only location where the item was sold, went on to publish an apology letter on Chinese microblogging platform Weibo, saying that it “regrets that demand could not be all met”.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2021/12/31/clean_2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:01</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Thousands queue at midnight to buy Disney toys in Shanghai</p><p>Thousands queue at midnight to buy Disney toys in Shanghai</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The frenzy around LinaBell, which was introduced as the latest member of Disney’s Duffy and Friends toy line, provides a glimpse of the amount of money that China’s younger generation is willing to spend on a product created by a foreign brand that is tailored to meet their unique tastes and preferences.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">May Peng, a woman in her 20s from Guangdong, said that she understands why people would find comfort in being greeted by LinaBell at Shanghai Disney Resort.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“She is a vivid character who is sometimes childish, and sometimes warm. The actor who played the role is very energetic and hard-working,” Peng said. “Think about it, if you can buy happiness with 500 yuan (US$78.4), why not? Life has been really hard, and LinaBell is the sweetest.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unlike most Disney characters, LinaBell became a hit in China without first appearing in a film or television show. Rather, just like so many personalities and characters who have found fame in the internet era, LinaBell first landed on many people’s radar through social media.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many fans said they first came across the cartoon fox when friends sent them virtual stickers made from LinaBell’s photos on Tencent Holdings’ ubiquitous messaging app WeChat. On social media platforms such as Weibo and Xiaohongshu, as well as video-streaming platforms like Bilibili, LinaBell has been featured in countless videos taken by tourists at Shanghai Disney Resort.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fans often refer to LinaBell as their “daughter”. Many even show interest in the Disney employees who dress as LinaBell at Shanghai Disney Resort. Internet users speculate that at least three different people have played the role, based on how the costume fits the person inside at different times.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China looks to Disney to help improve ties with the US</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a video that was reposted more than 700 times on Weibo within hours, LinaBell was seen comforting a woman who cried in joy on meeting the character. The fox gave her a hug, while dancing and wagging her tail, prompting one Weibo user to exclaim, “Our daughter is so warm. I almost cried, too.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think for many people, she is a character who lives in the fantasy world and will never hurt you,” Peng said. “Even though you know she is not a real person, just think about the actors who play the role – they are also trying their best to be kind. You will also encourage yourself to keep going.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Much of LinaBell’s appeal lies in the ability for fans to meet the character in person, said Zhu Changci, an analyst at market research firm Leadleo.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The interaction between LinaBell and the tourists makes her a vivid character that is not limited to simple text descriptions like ‘courage’ and ‘curiosity’,” Zhu said. “These interactions are in line with the personalities and consumption patterns of Generation Z.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The character’s popularity has sent the second-hand prices of LinaBell dolls soaring.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Most original LinaBell dolls are officially priced at around a few hundred yuan, but on Xianyu, a popular used goods trading platform owned by Alibaba Group Holding, some people are selling theirs at around 2,000 yuan – nearly 10 times the original price. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2021/12/31/clean_2.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, enterprising merchants are rushing to produce copycats, often sold for much less than the originals. On Xianyu and Alibaba’s business-to-business trading platform 1688.com, a search for LinaBell turned up dolls that cost as little as a few dozen yuan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A Xianyu merchant, who declined to be named, started selling LinaBell dolls for 158 yuan each – cheaper than Disney’s official price – more than a month ago. “Many [merchants] have made sewing patterns [based on the original version]. In just a few months’ time, I think almost all Disney fans had bought at least one [LinaBell] doll,” she said, adding that she expects LinaBell’s popularity to last for about half a year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These cheaper versions of LinaBell toys sometimes led to disappointment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A 27-year-old woman from Wuhan, who asked to be referred to as Jiali, said she received a LinaBell doll from her boyfriend as a surprise gift, only to find that its fur kept falling off, while its eyes looked a bit “spooky”. Her boyfriend said he spent 500 yuan on the doll, which came with a price tag of 219 yuan, from a seller on e-commerce platform Shihuo who claimed it was authentic.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Could China’s top theme parks offer a ‘model’ for tourism development?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It didn’t feel right when I got it,” Jiali said. “I’m pretty sure it’s fake after comparing it to others, but it really did a good job in making it look real.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jiali ended up applying for a refund, but said she understood how others would be happy to pay up.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s incredible how these sellers dare to sell a fake doll at 500 yuan,” she said. “[But] people can spend as much as they’re willing to pay for something they like.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwaavx2iZop9dqbKktI6aqa2hk6GycH%2BQb2lwaWVkurDCxGamr52iYrqqr8qesGaln6rApnnDoqqnnamoeqm7062crKxdnba1ecKhoKeZXaW2r7eMn6axZZOWua2xww%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lmco-apple-pie-jam.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>LMCo.
