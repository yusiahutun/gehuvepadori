He kept his reputation alive by uploading videos on YouTube, impersonating the famous comic character, Batman.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>BatDad, however, is not only popular for his family-friendly comedy sketches. The American content creator is also known for his adorable relationship with his children, whom he co-parents with his former wife&nbsp;Jen Wilson.</p><h2>Was Married To Jen For A Long Time</h2><p>The popular comedy video creator, BatDad, and his now-ex-wife, Jen Wilson, were together for a very long time. However, none of them had disclosed any information about where and when they shared the wedding vows. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It is known that they were blessed with four adorable children, three daughters named Taylor Wilson, Kaya Wilson, and Sienna Wilson, plus a son named Ben Wilson.</p><p>Their first-born is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Taylor Wilson</a>, whom they welcomed on December 21, 2004. Almost two-and-a-half years later, on June 18, 2007, they got blessed with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kaya Wilson</a>. Likewise, on June 26, 2010, the now-separated couple were blessed with their twin children, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sienna</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ben Wilson</a>.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>BatDad <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">considered</a>&nbsp;his partner as an important force to help him in parenting. In an interview with PBS back in March 2014, he stated that the superpower behind parenting kids needed both father and&nbsp;mother.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>With his wife, his family life seemed to be happy.&nbsp;All his family members used to be featured in almost every video BatDad made and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">uploaded</a>. However, things always don’t go the right way, and the same situation happened in the YouTuber's&nbsp;life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>They Separated In Early 2019</h2><p>Life was going pretty well for the popular content creator. He was uploading comedy videos, making his fanbase happy, and enjoying his time with his family. But little did BatDad know what time had stored for him.</p><p>The Wilsons amicably got <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">separated</a> in early 2019, and to date, they have kept the reason behind their divorce up to themselves only. However, during an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TODAY</a>, in 2013, BatDad had stated that his ‘Batman’ character often annoyed&nbsp;Jen, and he felt bad for her. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As the statement&nbsp;was almost six years ago&nbsp;from their separation, it can not be said it was the exact reason which made the duo part their ways.</p><h2>The Ex-Couple Co-Parent Their&nbsp;Children</h2><p>Following BatDad and Jen’s marriage dissolution, the custody of their children was to be decided.</p><p>By looking at the American Viner’s recent <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram posts</a>, it seems he was handed the responsibility of his twin children, Ben and Sienna Wilson, and the custody of his two daughters, Taylor and Kaya Wilson was given to Jen. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Even though BatDad and Jen got separated, the ex-pair seems to have maintained a grudge-free friendship between them to raise their children in a suitable environment.</p><p>On March 9, 2019, the YouTuber <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">uploaded</a> a video of him and Jen through his Facebook account and captioned it as “Funniest Jen and BatDad Moments!”</p><p>Moreover, after their divorce, the father of four&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was asked</a> by a fan if he and Jen were still together. While <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">replying</a> to that, he said that they are not together anymore but are still friends and are trying their best to be the world's co-parenting champions. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>BatDad Is Back To Dating</h2><p>BatDad has moved on from his divorce and is back to dating.</p><p>Revealing his relationship status, he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">mentioned</a>&nbsp;his girlfriend in an Instagram post uploaded on March 10, 2021. The post featured a mother cat named Lil Silly, whom the comedian had adopted. In the caption, he disclosed the cat had six&nbsp;kittens nine months ago, and he gave three to his ex-wife and three to his girlfriend.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Despite revealing his relationship status, BatDad didn't expose the identity of his girlfriend. But by the tone of it, it seems that his girlfriend is pretty close to his family, including his children.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnkpbBpa3DZq6inpVit6a6jJ2gr6eimLJvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./351217-best-tyres-kenya-prices-the-reliable-brands-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Best tyres in Kenya (with prices): The most reliable brands</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./twitter-goes-wild-over-macaulay-culkin-making-rare-public-appearance-at-2018-american-music-awards.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Twitter Goes Wild Over Macaulay Culkin at 2018 American Music Awards</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
