From using her own blood on a canvas for an art exhibit to starring in indie darling Uncut Gems, the Italian-American starlet has established herself as a true performer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Below, here's everything to know about the rising star.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">She appeared opposite Adam Sandler in her breakout role.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fox played Sandler's girlfriend in A24's critically acclaimed Uncut Gems, the 2019 crime thriller about a jewelry dealer with a gambling addiction.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The film was directed by the Safdie brothers, a filmmaker duo Fox has known for nearly a decade. Reflecting on how she got cast, Fox told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/12/9000181/julia-fox-uncut-gem-breakout-role-interview data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Refinery29 class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Refinery29</a>, "It was pretty easy, I would say. It’s not rocket science. Just like act and react, and memorize your lines. You really have to be able to let go, lose control, and destroy your ego. You’re not you, you have to let go of yourself and be this whole other person, and really feel the scene that you’re in. There is an art to it. You either have it or you don’t, I think."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For her performance, she was nominated for the Breakout Actor Award at the 2019 Gotham Awards.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While she impressed audiences in front of the camera in Uncut Gems, Fox has plans for doing more behind-the-scenes work in the future.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I’m going to act a little more, but then my bigger picture is writing, directing, [and] producing," she told Refinery29. "I have so many scripts. It’s about fine-tuning, and finding the right team. Even though I do love being in front of the camera, I feel more comfortable behind it. I just want to let my work speak for itself, and not always be the center of attention.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She previously wrote and directed Fantasy Girls, a 2021 short film about teenagers involved in sex work in Reno, Nevada.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">She's an artist.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fox has self-published two books of her own photography: 2015's <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.dashwoodbooks.com/pages/books/15555/julia-fox/heartburn-nausea?soldItem=true" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Symptomatic of a Relationship Gone Sour: Heartburn/Nausea" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Symptomatic of a Relationship Gone Sour: Heartburn/Nausea</a> and 2016's <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.printedmatter.org/catalog/46829/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=PTSD class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">PTSD</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2017, she even held her own funeral — or, more specifically, an art exhibition titled R.I.P. Julia Fox, curated by Richie Shazam. For the morbidly erotic show, Fox used her own blood on some of the silk canvases. She told the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sex-blood-and-the-ritual-of-rebirth-rip-julia_b_5919c010e4b00ccaae9ea4ec data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=HuffPost class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">HuffPost</a>,"I wanted the show to be as authentic and personal as possible.

The two are now separated.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Last month, Fox slammed Artemiev via an Instagram Story, in which she posted a photo of him with the message, "Have you seen this dead beat dad?"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a subsequent Story, she added, “I can’t even do it anymore. I just don’t want my son f–ked up cuz he feels like his dad was absent or loved alcohol and partying more than him... This man left me with a 5 month old and a dog and a home and ALL THE BILLS.
