It’s the ‘Barbie’ movie, Greta Gerwig’s directing it, and it’s filming in London for four months or something, so I told them you probably wouldn’t want to do it because you probably don’t want to go to London.”</p><p>Surprised, Cera immediately told his manager to call them back, asking:</p><p>“How can I not do it? I need to do it!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-manager-s-grave-mistake-was-resolved-with-greta-gerwig>Manager’s grave mistake was resolved with Greta Gerwig</h2><p>Born on&nbsp;7 June 1988 in Brampton, Canada, the 35-year-old thankfully managed to resolve the situation as he took it upon himself to get in touch with Greta Gerwig on his own.</p><p>In the interview, Cera revealed he personally emailed director Greta Gerwig begging her to be in Barbie after his manager said he wouldn’t be interested:</p><p>“I somehow got Greta’s email address, I think through a common friend of ours, and I emailed her like, “Can I be in it? Can I do that part?”</p><p>Cera stated that Gerwig responded by encouraging the pair to have a Zoom call, telling the actor:</p><p>‘”Let’s get on a Zoom right now. Here’s a Zoom link, I’ll be on there for the next hour.”</p><p>Once the creatives spoke about his role in the movie, “it just all happened really fast from there” according to Michael Cera.</p><p>The director was able to arrange a cameo for him in the film, featuring Margot Robbie in the titular role, Ryan Gosling as Ken, and Michael Cera as Allan.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-can-t-believe-barbie-almost-had-no-allan>Fans can’t believe Barbie almost had no Allan</h2><p>Unlike the copious numbers of Barbie and Ken characters in the live-action movie, Cera is the one and only Allan and fans can’t believe Cera almost didn’t get to play the iconic role.</p><p>GQ also shared the popular clip via their TikTok platform, whereby the video has currently reached over 850,000 views along with more than 90,000 likes and a comment section full of shock.</p><p>After his agent nearly cost him the role in the Barbie movie, fans took to the comments to share their thoughts on Barbie movie without Cera playing the iconic role of Allan.</p><p>A user named @marvelousromulus jokingly asked:</p><p>“Does he need a new manager??”</p><p>@YDK_Marshall suggested Cera’s manager was willing to let the Barbie opportunity go:</p><p>“Bro’s manager was nah we good over here lol.”</p><p>@Linda_Horrell stated that Michael Cera is “a perfect Alan…”</p><p>@KristaHans also shared their love for Allan’s character:</p><p>“Allan was one of my favorite parts.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-1531053185-1024x683.jpg><p>Another TikToker named @forcedtobehere420 highlighted that Greta Gerwig was able to work office hours to speak to Michael Cera via Zoom:</p><p>“So Greta does director office hours? Love that for her.”</p><p>Clearly a fan of the movie, @planetmotola used an iconic line from the film in their comment reading:</p><p>“Michael is Kenough.”</p><p>With Barbie going on to break multiple box office records since its recent release, Cera is probably glad he defied his manager’s advice and ended up starring in the movie.</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2aFcLnInJ%2BanZxisKa%2BwGaYpaWfqMFusMidpa1lkaW9pq3RZqCnZZKWv6O1xGakqK6ZmnqistOeqWalkaOuqLHRrGSgqpGrsm65yKyrmqOVZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./four-people-including-baby-teen-dead-fire-rips-lacey-township-nj-home-horrified-neighbors-hearing-screams-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>PICTURED: Three of four family members, including teenager and baby, who were killed in horrific New</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./luke-bryans-crash-my-playa-destination-concert-is-back-for-2023.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Luke Bryans Crash My Playa Destination Concert is Back for 2023</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
