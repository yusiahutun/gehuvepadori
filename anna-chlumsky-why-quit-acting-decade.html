Culkin would take a similar break through his own formative years from '94-'03.</p><p>"Throughout my adolescence, I was not getting booked," Chlumsky shared. "I was told I was too fat or too ugly. You live on a risk-reward system and I wasn't getting much reward."</p><p>And that's when she had that experience that told her that just because this is all she'd known for so many years at this point, it isn't all there is. "I knew I always wanted to go to school and get my education so I did that. And I'm glad that I did."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:188cba9d-752f-447e-b0e2-90d25b50befe data-container-ref=toofab:article:f80cf57e-6946-4843-b36a-e109a983c540 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/43/5by4/2022/01/26/4376d1db295948c086ab29835e1eebc5_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Macaulay Culkin and Brenda Song Reportedly Engaged as She Flashes Massive Ring</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>But the acting bug was real in Chlumsky, she just needed to come center and find herself before she was ready to step back into that world -- this time, on her terms. That's why she navigated her way back into entertainment through the stage experience, saying that it was Broadway productions that sparked inspiration in her again.</p><p>"it was alluring to apply my creativity towards something and tell a story -- but of my own decision making," she said. But even still, she was a little hesitant, telling the outlet she applied to the Atlantic Acting School with the intention of trying it out for a year to see if this was really her dream, or just that thing she did as a kid.</p><p>Luckily for her fans, she fell back in love immediately. "I realized, 'I'm not giving this a year. I freaking love it. I'm giving this the rest of my life.'"</p><p>The "Inventing Anna" star would go on to a whole new level of acclaim and fan support when she joined Julia Louis-Dreyfus and became one of the big breakout stars of "Veep" across seven seasons, picking up six Emmy nominations along the way.</p><p>Now, Chlumsky can be seen in the lead role as the journalist who uncovered the truth behind Julia Garner's Anna Delvey in "Inventing Anna," now streaming on Netflix.</p><a id=gallery-link-bfb257c5-1318-4231-ae9f-e1bb6d93f370 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:bfb257c5-1318-4231-ae9f-e1bb6d93f370 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:f80cf57e-6946-4843-b36a-e109a983c540 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f1/4by3/2022/01/08/f1cfacc1aeb940a393e8e678da895762_md.jpeg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j2tmamtflruvrYycn6Wtnai4unnWobBmqaWewW6twq2gp59dmbKkrcOeZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./as-bike-trail-plans-to-cross-the-country-quad-cities-to-benefit.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>As bike trail plans to cross the country, Quad Cities to benefit</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alibaba-pushes-ai-tools-merchants-wanting-tap-overseas-markets-competition-temu-and-shein-heats.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alibaba pushes AI tools to merchants wanting to tap overseas markets, as competition with Temu and S</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
