However, rumors say he didn’t pay for her engagement ring.</strong></p><p>Both Darcey and Georgi <a href=#>have already done the whole wedding</a> and getting married thing, but have since been re-engaged. He proposed to the Silva sister in June 2020 after four months of dating and she said yes.</p><p>However, they are now getting ready to pay half of their ‘twin wedding’, as Stacey Silva and Florian Sukaj prepare to share their special day with them. As the conversation of costs came up, fans speculated about Georgi’s income.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><p>Some viewers are also saying that he didn’t pay for Darcey’s engagement ring. Let’s explore the rumors.</p>BridTV691590 Day Fiancé | Before the 90 Days Season 5 Trailer910039910039center22403<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-say-georgi-didn-t-pay-for-ring>Fans say Georgi didn’t pay for ring</h2><p>Although unconfirmed, multiple Darcey & Stacey viewers have assumed that Darcey paid for her own engagement ring. It comes despite Georgi making the decision to propose – both the first and second time.</p><p>She looked totally surprised when he got down on one knee for the reengagement, but fans have other ideas about how Georgi got the money to pay for the glinting ring, especially as he is no longer a masseur.</p><p>One <a href=#>wrote</a>: “Well he returned the first one to their company House of 11 and paid the difference on their site of $60 unless hopefully he got a discount lmao.”</p><p>Another <a href=#>said</a>: “Darcey bought it – it will be shown on Tell All.” However, there are a few viewers who have Georgi’s back, such as one who guessed he may have made the money on giving massages.</p><p>“Seriously!! Good credit or not. They don’t give you that big of a limit with no job in the past two years!!“, <a href=#>penned</a> a fan.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Me trying to be happy for Darcey but quickly remembering that Georgi not having his own money has been a key plot point of the season… so Darcey paid for own ring on top of all the romantic gestures that "Georgi did".<a href=#>#darceyandstacey</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/dkqLxiEywS</a></p>— Socially Distant Robynne 🇨🇦😷 (@RockynRobynne) <a href=#>February 22, 2022</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-paid-for-darcey-s-engagement-ring>Who paid for Darcey’s engagement ring?</h2><p>Stacey claimed that Darcey pays for Georgi’s food, so it would make sense if she forked out on the engagement ring. As of 2020, the TLC star had worked as a masseur for six years, but Covid-19 came between Georgi and his career.</p><p>The majority of rumors say that Darcey paid for her own ring, however it is currently thought that Georgi upgraded the old one – which she originally paid for – and paid the difference.</p><p>Darcey revealed on the show that he is no longer working as a masseur due to COVID-19, as he doesn’t want to risk catching it. However, this wasn’t Georgi’s only source of income as he also has his own Only Fans page.</p><p>He charges subscribers $11.99 per month, so he has been focusing on this since the pandemic, as well as his aspirations to become a full-time model, a job he previously had while living in Bulgaria.</p><p>However, reports say his net worth involves funds out of Darcey’s money pot, who has a net worth of $1million.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Florian hasn’t gotten a job yet but sure got opinions.

However, their father Mike Silva claims he will not be attending.</p><p>It will be the first time Darcey and Georgi officially tie the knot, but it comes as the second time for the couple to get engaged. He told her to “close her eyes” during a beach dinner with her two daughters <a href=#>Aniko and Aspen Bollok</a>.</p><p>At age 46, Darcey went on to say she is ready to start her life and get married. However, a confessional showed Stacey revealing that she wasn’t sure if she wanted to share her special day with her sister.</p><p>Darcey’s father Mike threatened not to attend her wedding if Georgi Rusev is the groom. With the opinion that she shouldn’t marry the <a href=#>rose oil entrepreneur</a>, he won’t be walking her down the aisle.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by TLC (@tlc)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH DARCEY AND STACEY ON TLC EVERY MONDAY AT 8/7C</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>INSTAGRAM</a> AND <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>FACEBOOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfqsCiedGemKWhpK56tcKOn5inq12YuaK1zGabmqqTmsa0ecWimKeblWK0prvRoKBmnJmZu7V5z5qwZp6fp3qpsdFmnKefkZyyrrHNrWSroZ6c</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./04-0405-20240316-126-directo-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alcaraz - Sinner, | Resumen y resultado de las semifinales de Indian Wells</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sinead-oconnors-heartwarming-tribute-revealed-ahead-of-funeral.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Daily Lowdown: Sinead O'Connor's heartwarming tribute revealed ahead of funeral</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
