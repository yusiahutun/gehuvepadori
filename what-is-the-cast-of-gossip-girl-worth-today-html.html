For five years, audiences followed the misadventures of high society teens from the Upper East Side of Manhattan. From cocktails at The Empire to hanging on the steps of The Met, Gossip Girl ignited a new generation of teen drama fans.</p><p id=par-3_34>The cast portrayed rich (and sometimes infamous) elitists on the show. But years after the show ended, how are the actors’ financial portfolios doing now? Here’s the tea on the cast’s net worth. Xoxo.</p><h2>Kelly Rutherford</h2><p id=par-4_4><strong>Net worth:</strong> <a href=#>$1 million&nbsp;</a></p><p id=par-6_61>As dignified (and husband hopping) wife and mother Lily van der Woodsen, Rutherford played the part perfectly. Her career spans decades as she <a href=#>had roles</a> in other iconic series like Melrose Place and the reboot of Dynasty. Rutherford also appeared in films like Scream 3 and is currently in the updated version of Pretty Little Liars (Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists).</p><p id=par-7_51>Rutherford made unfortunate headlines for an <a href=#>extremely ugly custody battle</a> of her small children. She shared custody with her ex who lived abroad. At one point, when she was supposed to send the children back to live with their father, she refused. This sunk her into extreme legal and financial woes.</p><h2>Taylor Momsen</h2><p id=par-8_4><strong>Net worth:</strong> <a href=#>$4 million</a></p><p id=par-10_50>Momsen played little Jenny Humphrey. A good girl from a good family, who goes bad in the long run. Momsen worked steadily leading up to her role in Gossip Girl.

Her band, The Pretty Reckless toured with Chris Cornell right before he died.&nbsp;Audioslave guitarist, Tom Morello told&nbsp;SiriusXM about Cornell’s last words delivered to Momsen. Even though she was on tour with Cornell, Momsen hadn’t met him and was starstruck.&nbsp;“Chris walked over to her and said, ‘hey Taylor, welcome to the tour, glad you’re on board, you’re going to do great thing in your career and so glad that you are with us.’ Which made her world as you could imagine, which gave her great excitement for the rest of the tour and the future,” Morello recounts <a href=#>Alternative Nation</a> Reports.</p><p id=par-12_28>“That was the last time anybody had seen or heard from Chris Cornell,” he added. Momsen was devastated and ended up canceling the rest of the band’s performances.</p><h2>Ed Westwick</h2><p id=par-13_4><strong>Net worth:</strong> <a href=#>$4 million</a></p><p id=par-15_45>The infamous Chuck Bass had a significant evolution during the series.
