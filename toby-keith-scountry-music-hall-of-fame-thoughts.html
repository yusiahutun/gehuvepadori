So, he was unaware that soon, he'd be a member.</p><p>We asked him, however, if he thought he would ever make it in. Here's what he replied:</p><p>"Don't ask me, I don't know how that works. They usually wait 'til you die, don't they? Don't you have to be 85 to get in there?"</p><p>After a few chuckles, the "Red Solo Cup" singer got serious.</p><p>"You know, I'm in&nbsp;five Hall of Fames. Above all of 'em, the two Songwriter Hall of Fames, and the BMI Icon were the three."</p><p>"I mean the People's Choice is wonderful, and the Oklahoma&nbsp;Hall of&nbsp;Fame is great, and the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame is great," he noted. "But getting into Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and the worldwide songwriters Hall of Fame ... I would have been a songwriter either way."</p><p>Keith&nbsp;recalled how he was unexpectedly&nbsp;accepted into country music as not only a songwriter, but a singer.</p><p>"They just happened to accept — it wasn't up to me, it was up to the fans, but, they just happened to accept me as an artist, so I had a vehicle to deliver all those songs. A lot of people in the&nbsp;Hall of Fame were never really artists, and I happen to be able to just not have to pitch my songs and record them."</p><p>Of course, he would go on to become one of the biggest stars of his time, but he was happy just writing songs.</p><p>"I didn't want the CMAs and the music awards shows and all that stuff — that was just a place to show up and get promoted and be relevant," Keith said last fall. "The couple things that I really wanted was to someday stand up there and accept a nomination into the&nbsp;Hall of&nbsp;Fame as a songwriter."</p><p>Toby Keith died on Feb. 5, 2024, <a href=#>one day before ballots were returned</a> revealing that he'd been voted into this year's class.</p><p>A formal induction for the 2024 Country Music Hall of Fame Class will happen this fall. In addition to Keith,&nbsp;<a href=#>John Anderson&nbsp;</a>and James Burton join as&nbsp;<a href=#>Country Music Hall of Fame</a>&nbsp;inductees.</p><p><i>Evan Paul is the host of&nbsp;</i><a id=OWA8d085e9c-0e3c-148e-6359-58324bebb778 class="x_x_x_ContentPasted0 x_x_ContentPasted0 x_OWAAutoLink" title="Original URL: https://tasteofcountry.com/category/taste-of-country-nights/.
