During an interview with Zane Lowe on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Apple Music's Beats 1</a>, however, she explains that success wasn't guaranteed and that when she just started out — and even now — she's often reduced to being nothing more than a girl singing about boys.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When I was 23 and people were just kind of reducing me to, like, kind of making slideshows of my dating life and putting people in there that I'd sat next to at a party once," Swift explained.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added that she's had to endure a specific kind of slut-shaming, because critics don't take into account all the hard work that goes into writing her own material. They simply take all the success and dismiss it because the way they see it, Swift is doing nothing more than taking a romantic situation and turning it into a song.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kevin Winter/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's a way to take a woman who's doing her job and succeeding at doing her job and making things, and — in a way — it's figuring out how to completely minimize that skill by taking something that everyone in their darkest, darkest moments loves to do, which is just to slut-shame," Swift added. "So now when I see this happening, I can see a headline about a young artist, about a young female artist, about another breakup, and it sends me into a real sad place because I don't want that to keep happening."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She called out the double standard in music, saying that all the things that female artists strive for, such as money, love, and success, are fine for their male counterparts to want. When women want them, however, it's frowned upon and, Swift says, "wrong."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't think people understand how easy it is to infer that someone who's a female artist or a female in our industry is somehow doing something wrong by wanting love, wanting money, wanting success," she noted. "Women are not allowed to want those things the way that men are allowed to want them, and so I think when I was the youngest, it was hard because I didn't understand why nobody was saying that this was wrong."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But, Swift says that she wouldn't change anything. It's not her responsibility to censor herself just because people will pick her apart for wanting to be in a relationship. The way she sees it, she had a "normal" dating life, except for the fact that everything she did made headlines.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I can look back at those lessons I learned when I was younger and I really truly don't think I did anything wrong by having a normal dating life in my early 20s," she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeklsatu9FmqrChlql6tLjUrWSsoJGisqV5xaipZqCRq7avs4yrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqes</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./best-black-youtube-creators.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 50 Best Black YouTube Creators To Subscribe To Right Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./prince-harry-and-meghan-have-nothing-left-and-are-scrambling-for-new-deals.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Prince Harry and Meghan 'have nothing left' and are 'scrambling for new deals'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
