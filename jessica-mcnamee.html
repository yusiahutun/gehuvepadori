Her big-screen debut occurred in the 2009 horror-thriller film ‘The Loved Ones’ which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2009. She played a Goth-minded sister to a murder victim in this movie.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u101be9ae7d3339c0975ba0a30fb08d48><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Daniel Henney Biography</span></a><p>McNamee debuted in the American Film Industry with the film “The Vow,” as the younger sister of amnesia sufferer Rachel McAdams in 2012.

She said it was difficult playing someone who has recently aired their controversial views on same-sex marriage in the public arena. Margaret had some controversial views regarding the LGBT community. As McNamee was playing her in “Battle of the sexes”, it really tested her as an actress but also gave her the opportunity to discuss her own ideas about marriage equality. She had quite different and liberal views regarding the LGBT community as compared to Margaret and knew how to convey that to the audience in the right sense.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Jessica McNamee Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Jessica McNamee</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>17 June 1986</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2021)</td><td>34 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Sydney,&nbsp;New South Wales, Australia</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Australian</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>Gemini</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jessica-McNamee-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 5” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 167 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 52 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 114 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Body Measurements</td><td>34-25-35</td></tr><tr><td>Bra Size</td><td>32B</td></tr><tr><td>Waist Size</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Hips Size</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Shoe Size</td><td>7 (U.S.)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Honey Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Blue</td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Slim</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>Peter McNamee</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Helen McNamee</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>Penny McNamee, Mel McNamee, Rebecca McNamee , Abbey McNamee</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>Patrick McNamee</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Qualification/Education</h3></th></tr><tr><td>School</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>Swinburne University</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jessica-McNamee-3.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>In Relation</td></tr><tr><td>Affair</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Is she a Lesbian?</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Boyfriend?</td><td>Sean Richard O’Pry</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Favorite Things</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Favorite Sport</td><td>Tennis</td></tr><tr><td>Favorite Song</td><td>Grown Woman by&nbsp;Beyoncé</td></tr><tr><td>Favorite Outfit</td><td>Levi’s jeans, paired with sandals and a cute top</td></tr><tr><td>Favorite Midnight Snack</td><td>Apple&nbsp;and peanut butter</td></tr></tbody></table><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u94954422f346b600cc61d26a6acf78eb><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Alessia Zecchini Biography</span></a><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>McNamee’s personal life is very much away from her professional career and she likes to keep her personal life low key.
