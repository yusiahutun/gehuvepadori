While you can pick any of these products, we suggest that you go through our following buying guide to understand factors to consider while buying them.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Choose the Best Keratin Shampoo with Sulfate-free Formulas?</h2></p><p>Keratin-treated hair requires a lot more care to help maintain its softness and shine. Picking the highest-rated or pricier product isn’t the way to go about it. To make sure you pick the best keratin shampoo with a sulfate-free formula, you need to consider a few key factors to make an informed decision.</p><p><strong>Hair Type:</strong></p><p>When it comes to hair products, the first thing to consider is which hair type it is designed for. Be it dry, oily, curly, color-treated, or chemically treated, each hair requires a specific set of ingredients to show efficacy. Even with the best keratin shampoo with a sulfate-free formula, each product addresses specific hair concerns and hair types. If you have chemically treated or colored hair, check if the keratin shampoo is safe for such hair. In short, inspect the hair type suitability before choosing a shampoo.</p><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><p>When choosing a keratin shampoo most people opt for a sulfate-free formula. However, sulfate is not the only chemical that might have hair damaging effects. Ideally, you should also avoid shampoos that contain harsh chemicals like parabens, phthalates, alcohol, and even formaldehyde, or artificial dyes. These can strip off the hair’s natural oils and lead to a lot of damage and dryness.</p><p>Always look for ingredients that have nourishing properties. Pick the ones with argan oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil, shea butter, vitamin E, or the ones formulated with plant-based proteins. These help in promoting healthy hair and scalp boosts hair growth, and enhances hair texture. It is, however, best to pick a formula that is enriched with plant-derived or natural components to ensure it is free from harsh chemicals, synthetic ingredients, and adulterants.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/select/images/quick_tip_bulb_icon.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2 class=exp-tip--head--style>Pro Tip</h2><p class=exp--tip--content>Use sulfate-free keratin shampoo to revive your hair. Gently lather and focus on roots. Rinse well for stronger, smoother locks. Repeat 2-3 times a week for best results.</p><p><strong>Formula:</strong></p><p>After the ingredients, the next thing to check in a sulfate-free shampoo for keratin treated hair is its benefits. Remember, you must pick a formula that matches and aligns with your desired results. While most keratin shampoos help in eliminating split ends, and hair manageability, you must pick a formula that does more to your hair. It should have other benefits like reducing frizz, improving elasticity, repairing damaged hair, increasing shine, and boosting healthy hair growth. It must also enhance your hair texture, strengthen, and boost volume. Make sure that the formula lathers richly to avoid hair tugging and breakage during hair wash. Along with this, ensure that the formula provides gentle cleansing, it should be mild but thorough.</p><p><strong>Brands and Budget:</strong></p><p>It is a common misbelief that the higher the price; the better the product. One must never go with such logic and instead focus on factors like ingredients and formulation to determine if the product is worth investing in. Look for a reputed brand that specializes in hair care and has positive product reviews. If you are still skeptical about a product, it is best to invest in a smaller size or a travel-size sample to test out its effectiveness and how your hair and scalp react to it. Through our trial and error, we discovered that, what might work for one, might not work for the others. So, make sure you look through the ingredient list and then pick a product.</p><p>After making sure you pick the best keratin shampoo with a sulfate-free formula, it is important to know how to use the shampoo correctly for maximum effectiveness.</p><p><h2 class=title>How To Use the Keratin Shampoo Sulfate-Free?</h2></p><p>To get the most out of the best shampoo after a keratin treatment, it is important to use it correctly. Here are a few general steps that you need to follow to make your hair lustrous and shiny:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by dampening your hair thoroughly with lukewarm water. Make sure that your hair is completely wet from roots to tips.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Take a generous amount (depending on the length of your hair) of your sulfate-free keratin shampoo on your palm and distribute it evenly through your hair. Focus on the roots and scalp and work your way down towards the tips.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Gently massage your scalp with your fingertips and cleanse it thoroughly to eliminate build-up. It is best to massage the shampoo into your scalp in circular motions as it helps to stimulate the scalp and improve blood circulation.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Optional):</strong> Some keratin shampoos have specific instructions to leave the product on for a couple of minutes to allow the ingredients to penetrate in your hair shafts for optimum benefits. So, if your shampoo has such instructions, it is best to leave it on for the recommended time before rinsing.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After massaging and lathering it up, it's time to rinse your scalp and hair thoroughly. Make sure that no shampoo residue remains in your hair, as it can weigh it down and make it appear greasy or oily.</p><p><strong>Step 6 (Recommended): </strong>To get optimal results for your hair, it is always recommended to use a suitable (preferably keratin-based) conditioner after shampooing. Apply the conditioner from the mid-length of your hair and work it toward the tips. Avoid the scalp area and leave it on for a few minutes and then rinse it off thoroughly.</p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> After rinsing, gently squeeze out the excess water from your hair. Avoid rubbing your hair vigorously with a towel, as it can lead to a lot of friction and may also cause frizz. Instead, grab a soft microfiber towel or an old cotton t-shirt and pat down your hair. Then proceed with your usual styling routine.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Keratin is an important element for your hair as it helps in improving the overall hair health and strengthens it.
