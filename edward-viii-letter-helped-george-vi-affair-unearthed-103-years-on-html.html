Chisholm was an Australian socialite who became the inspiration for the famous phrase Down Under - which was supposedly named after her - 'a good-looking sheila'.&nbsp;Chisholm was a renown 'it-girl' around the time of the First World War, having dazzled many in high society with her beauty.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She married three times - Lord Loughborough, Sir John Charles Peniston Milbanke and Prince Dmitri Alexandrovich of Russia. But she was also close the future kings of the British Empire Edward VIII and George VI, having a romantic liaison with the latter. But their time together ended when his father, King George V, told him to find a more suitable, unmarried, partner. He went on to marry&nbsp;Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, Queen Elizabeth II's mother.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sheila was an Australian beauty from Wollogorang, two days' ride south of Sydney. She was a darling of the gossip columns, where her fashion style and antics were scrutinized with the same breathless fascination as those of Cara Delevigne or Pippa Middleton today.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Yet her life of glittering hedonism was marked by deep sadness. She was divorced twice, and outlived two of her three husbands and one of her sons. As a young mother she effectively brought up her two boys as a single parent while her husband, Lord Loughborough, struggled with the hopeless addictions to alcohol and gambling that would eventually ruin him. And during the Second World War she, like other war wives and mothers, suffered the anguish of not knowing when, or if, she would see her son and husband again.&nbsp;</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>The letter reads: 'I simply couldn't hit a ball at golf & Bertie beat my head off, f- him... we motored on to Winchester reaching Lankhills at 5:30.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'After tea I managed to lure Loughie [Lord Loughborough] away on the pretext of wanting to play a few more holes of golf on the local course, so as to give Sheilie a chance of being alone with Bertie; they said they were tired & we left them...'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The two-page pencil note, signed 'David', has emerged for sale for £2,500 with London-based Forum Auctions.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>George VI, then in his early 20s, and Sheila, an Australian socialite, met at a dance at Stafford House in London in 1918, with their affair lasting until 1920.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He had been warned off seeing her by his father King George V and she returned to Australia with Lord Loughborough in a bid to save their failing marriage.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But they remained friends and corresponded by letter.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>George VI met Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon - the Queen Mother - shorty after he ended his interest in Sheila and they married in 1923.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Edward VIII left Freda in 1934 and met American divorcee socialite Wallis Simpson, abdicating the throne in 1937 so they could marry.
