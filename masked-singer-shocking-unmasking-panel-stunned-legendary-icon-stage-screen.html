They're clearing shooting for the stars with their guesses -- but it's safe to say tonight's unmasked icon definitely fits that bill, even as they definitely deserved to keep it on and move on in the competition.</p><p>So who got robbed of their chance in the Group B finals, and who did the robbing? Who got upset -- aside from all of us -- and who did the upsetting? Well, there's only one way to find out, isn't there?</p><p>Let's jump right in with this week's mask.

We do this because we love ... to torture you.</p><p>Along with the panel's guesses, we'll be sharing some internet speculation, too, so if you don't want to be potentially <strong>spoiled </strong>(because they are very good at this), you may want to skip past the guesses sections.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:05c47ffd-650e-446c-a078-0f6250cce332 data-container-ref=toofab:article:02a30af6-731c-46c6-95a3-05f609017147 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5b/5by4/2024/04/24/5b54c8df265c4f42adaecc8828ae4abb_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">CBS / Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Drew Barrymore's Night with New Kids on the Block's Jordan Knight Was 'Every Girl's Fantasy'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h3 class=h3>FILLER</h3><h3 class=h3>The Panel</h3><p>("Wannabe," Spice GIrls) What a fun way to kick off the show, with Ken and Jenny particularly having fun with Scary Spice's rap lines. Rita and Robin appeared to be trying pretty hard to show off what they can do vocally, but they are also people who still want to maintain and grow their music careers … so we get it. Interestingly, Robin kind of threw in the towel early, while Rita and Jenny just poured they all into it until it was over.</p><h3 class=h3>ROUND 1: GROUP B</h3><h3 class=h3>Miss Cleocatra</h3><p>("Free Your Mind," En Vogue) <strong>Miss Cleocatra </strong>is clearly a diva who may be decades past the peak of her popularity, but still has that enduring quality that the real ones never seem to lose. Her voice is showing its age a bit, but still has incredible power and so much character. This was a great song choice for her as she was able to inject so much true passion into it.</p><p><strong>Guesses:</strong> The love of her mother was the theme of her "Girl Group" package, where she said she was proud to inspire the next generation of girls just as her mother inspired her. She also mentioned Michelle Obama's mother while sharing that both women "look to her."</p><p>Additionally, we saw photos of Bette Midler and Whoopi Goldberg as Miss Cleocatra talked about having her own "gang of great women" who shaped her. Other visual clues included a snake, a 5 domino and what looked like a blue-glowing wedding band at the end.</p><p>Her on-stage clue came courtesy of Wilson Phillips star (and Season 8's Lamb) Carnie Wilson. She sang a few lines from "Stop! In the Name of Love." By way of explanation, Miss Cleocatra added, "Well, The Supremes aren't just on my playlist. They're a part of my career!"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d0732e4a-6a32-4168-b338-fa4c888e71c4 data-container-ref=toofab:article:02a30af6-731c-46c6-95a3-05f609017147 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f4/5by4/2024/04/24/f4f6955dd2124d0f82254906e5c0d77c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty / Everett</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Tori Spelling Reveals Her Confession to Brian Austin Green Amid Dean McDermott Divorce</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In her previous outing, Miss Cleaocatra told us she was inspired most by Glinda, the Good Witch. Like Ugly Sweater, she was given a chair to sit in during the panel's discussion, which again has us thinking an older performer who either has some mobility issues, or just struggles moving around in this huge, heavy costume.</p><p>Her clues included the notion that her life went from "gorgeous rainbows to horrendous black-and-white." She suggested that she was considered a national treasure, but wasn't able to feel that she'd earned that. Instead, she felt "wicked."</p><p>That is, until a diagnosis made everything crystal clear. It was one she "never wanted, but desperately needed." Now, she's glad she reached out for help. Visual clues included an hourglass, a crown, crow, and green luggage labeled, "Vacay!" and a sign reading, "Bel-Air."</p><p>On-stage, Miss Gulch brought out her clue, a magic wand. "I've already worked my magic on an Emmy-award-winning show," Miss Cleocatra explained.</p><p>Rita took The Supremes clue and figured maybe they're of the same era, leading her to speculate that maybe it was Roberta Flack, who wrote a song for Bette Midler. Robin, however thought of the Dreamgirls musical, and the film Jumping the Broom (for the wedding band) to land on Loretta Devine.</p><p>Ken, meanwhile, considered Diana Ross herself, though pivoting down toward her daughter Tracee Ellis Ross and her diva mother from black-ish, Jenifer Lewis. He even brought his own receipts, reminding everyone she sang backup for Bette and was in Sister Act with Whoopi.</p><p>It's the guess the internet has been all over since she first appeared, and they're not backing down now.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Yep Ken's right!

They sing so powerfully individually, they have to be solo artists who also just happen to harmonize and perform well together. So either a duo that broke up, maybe, or solo artists that combined forces.</p><p><strong>Guesses:</strong> The duo talked about how different they were from one another this time around, but said they just embraced their individuality and it worked. One described himself as a "ladies man," while the other said he was a "tough guy."</p><p>They talked about their decision to team up being the best thing, and they're still touring -- or "on the menu" they said, as they showed one. This followed an airplane ticket and what appeared to be mistletoe.</p><p>Season 2's Black Widow Raven-Symoné (and one-time Cheetah Girl) came out to sing their on-stage clue, which was SWV's "Weak" -- this one even got the crowd singing along; talk about an iconic track. "We made our audience weak on the knees on Broadway," Beets shared.</p><p>Their biggest Oz-spirations are Dorothy and Toto because of their "loyalty as friends." Our first instinct when they started singing was Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, then we started wondering about the Damons Wayan, but can any of them really sing this well?</p><p>The clue package said that for them, home is wherever they were together. They noted that at one point they had 40 million eyes on them, while a picture of a radio was on the screen One gifted the other the book Beeting the Odds, which led to card playing and the two of hearts.</p><p>They also described one another as the one with the "big ol' brain" and the one with the "unbeatable heart." On stage, Toto came out as the clue. "Like Toto and Dororthy, we're the best of friends," Beets explained. "And we're pretty good co-stars, too."</p><p>Robin confused himself a bit this week by suddenly picking up a bit of a country vibe, considering Brooks & Dunn. Jenny, though, wondered if perhaps it was Broadway stars -- and Schmigadoon! Co-stars -- TItuss Burgess and Alan Cumming.</p><p>Rita went off the rails a bit speculating that Scrubs co-stars Zach Braff and Donald Faison have the singing chops to pull off these kinds of performances. Have you seen their latest commercial with Jason Momoa?</p><p>No, the internet has this one spot-on. American Idol Season 2 winner and runner-up Ruben Studdard and Clay Aiken joined up years back to star touring together and they've been successfully at it ever since. On top of that, just listen and you can absolutely hear their distinctive pipes.

Even more, he really impressed with the power and upper range of his voice. This was total command, and you could feel how much emotion was pouring through him as he dedicated this one to the woman he clearly sees as his personal North Star.</p><p><strong>Guesses:</strong> Gumball's wife was the main topic of his second clue package, with him sharing that she was this angel across the room when he first met her and they envisioned their future together. She was then hit with a medical diagnosis which changes how her future looks, leaving them with a major decision to make. They decided to live large and explore this world.</p><p>Visual clues in the package included a "Prom King" sash, crescent moon, a globe used to knock down three bowling pins, and angel wings and a halo when he talked about first seeing his wife … and how he still sees her.</p><p>Carnie Wilson returned to ask all the right questions with Pussycat Dolls' "Don't Cha," to which Gumball added, "Well don't you wish you could have starred with Channing Tatum like me." He added a little groove dance, which immediately evoked Magic Mike.</p><p>"For me, it's the Tin Man. When you met him, he was a little rusty, maybe just like me." That's what Gumball said when asked which Oz character inspired him the most. In his clue package, he opened up about his rocky road to stardom.</p><p>That included shockingly getting booed off the stage at a talent competition ... for winning! He said that he'd always known he wanted to be on the stage, he just couldn't figure out his path. Cue montage of playing drums, guitar, beatboxing, dancing, maybe even singing.</p><p>Visual cues included a horse-drawn chariot, a heart around the "American South," and Mississippi in particular, as well as a black spider dropping on a red-and-white mushroom. His on-stage clue arrived via flying monkey carrying a heart clock.</p><p>"At the end of the day, Tin Man always had the heart of a superhero, and I actually might, too." Rita wondered if he was hinting at The Boys and its Southern boy from Texas, Chace Crawford.</p><p>Rita is thinking is an actor, guessing maybe his Bullet Train co-star (if she remembered correctly) Aaron Taylor Johnson. Jenny speculated Derek Hough based on the combination of dance moves and vocals. Certainly his wife has been dealing with a more recent medical situation. She also tied the globe to his show World of Dance.</p><p>Ken, though, found himself convinced it might be Taran Killam. Taran's wife Cobie Smulders was diagnosed with cancer the same year as Ken's wife. He said there's no greater joy than performing for the one you love as the spouse of a cancer survivor.</p><p>Gumball has had the panel and the viewers at home stumped since we first met him, but there is a name that started cropping up a little more frequently this week.</p><p>Scott Porter, best known for Friday Night Lights has some bona fide singing chops and Off-Broadway credits to his name. Even more telling, his wife Kelsey Mayfield Porter tested positive for the Huntingon's gene, meaning she will eventually face the effects of the disease.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#TheMaskedSinger</a></p><p>Hmm couldn’t be a Magic Mike guy.

This is not a professional singer, or even someone who sings on the side. He may be someone who enjoys a few drinks and karaoke, or rocks out in the shower, but that's as far as we can hear it. The notes were all over the place, the cadence inconsistent, all the things that solidify that this is not what he does.</p><p><strong>Guesses:</strong> Seal told us that he was "mistakenly perceived as a wild child," but was actually not. Nevertheless, he is well known from our "screens, radios, or posters tacked up on your walls." A poster he showed featured Seal with vampire fangs.</p><p>He shared that he was part of "one of the most famous groups in the world," while additional visual clues included a stuffed polar bear, treasure chest, a lab set, and drivers license.</p><p>His on-stage clue was "BO$$" by Fifth Harmony, as performed by Raven-Symoné. He contextualized it by saying, "It's easy to be confident when you have a boss like Steven Spielberg."</p><p>Ken quickly thought of Haley Joel Osment, who starred in A.I. Jenny considered Gremlins, instead, while also thinking of The Goonies group to land on Corey Feldman, who could sound like that as a singer. Robin was in a similar lane, considering Sean Astin.</p><p>In this case, the X-sphere (formerly the Twitter-sphere) was actually aligning with someone from the panel, convinced that the Seal -- who just asked to make out with Rita after she guessed her husband Waika Taititi -- is actually Corey Feldman.

Instead, he played with the audience loving the cuteness of his costume.
