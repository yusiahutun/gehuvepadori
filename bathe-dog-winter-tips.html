Bathe your dog in the morning</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">The biggest concern with bathing your dog in the winter is the possibility of hypothermia, so it's important to keep them warm.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">The specialists at Showerstoyou.co.uk explain: "It's recommended to bathe your dog in the morning in winter, so they can dry off in the afternoon when the sun has reached its warmest.

Pay close attention to their paws</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Your dog's paws may need more attention during the winter months, as nails might collect salt or snow on outdoor walks.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">"Examining your dog's claws frequently is more important because in the winter, as your pet isn't as active, you may notice that their nails seem to grow longer. Long nails make it difficult for dogs to retain a firm hold in the bath which can lead to them falling over."</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-ehc3s et3p2gv0">3. Brushing your dog before and after the bath</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">According to the experts, it's best to brush your dog's fur before and after bathing them to remove any loose fur and debris. "All dog breeds shed occasionally, so it's advisable to remove any extra dead hair before shampooing," the team say.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">"Before bathing, brushing your pet's hair will help remove any matting and tangles, making the process simpler and more enjoyable for both you and your dog."</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-ehc3s et3p2gv0">4. Use cotton balls to clean ears<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">It's common for dogs to get water in their ears, but if left unattended, this could lead to an ear infection. To prevent water from getting into your pup's ears, block their external ear canal with a large cotton ball before bath time — just don't forget to remove it after your pet leaves the water.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">"Dogs dislike getting water in their ears, therefore they may shake off mid-bath in an effort to get the water out. This can be avoided by inserting a little cotton ball into your pet's ears during bathing, making the experience more relaxing for your dog."</p><img alt="standard wire haired dachshund at bath time" title="Dog having a bath" width=2484 height=1656 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dog-having-bath-1667382631.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-o6q7mr e6iqukd2">Keep It 100</span><span class="css-1xncx8o e6iqukd0">//</span><span class="css-o6q7mr e6iqukd1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-ehc3s et3p2gv0">5. Adjust the temperature</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">"It's not recommended to give your dog a cold bath as it's bad for their health. It's best to slightly warm the water in winter, this way they will be comfortable, feel relaxed and enjoy their bath," the experts say.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">"It is crucial to be careful with the water temperature and ensure it is 37°C / 98.6°.

Don't get water in their nose</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Water can get up a dog's nose from time to time. While it doesn't cause any harm, it can be an uncomfortable experience for them. To avoid this, lift up their head slightly and pay close attention to the nose. If there is too much water inside the nostrils, the risk of choking increases.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h2 css-ehc3s et3p2gv0">7.

Rinse and repeat</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">The team say: "Bathing your dog doesn't have to be a drawn-out process. Rinsing your dog off fast but thoroughly is important to prevent leftover suds which can irritate your dog's skin. Rinsing quickly also means that your dog spends less time exposed to the chilly air."</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h2 css-ehc3s et3p2gv0">9. Dry your dog</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Dogs are unable to regulate their temperatures in the same way we do, so getting your furry friend dry after bath time is very important — especially during the winter months.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">"After you have finished bathing your dog, blow-dry them with a hairdryer set to the lowest heat setting.
