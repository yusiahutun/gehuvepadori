But more recently, end-of-life, or so-called "death doulas," are becoming increasingly popular, especially among millennials, in light of the current COVID-19 global pandemic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Death doulas (also called death midwives) have been around since the early aughts, according to Alua Arthur, an end-of-life doula and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Going with Grace,</a> who also happens to be an attorney, adjunct professor, and ordained minister. "It is definitely a new movement, but as long as people have been living, people have been dying and others have been supporting them through it," Arthur explains. "It's as old as humankind itself, but with a new name and new attention."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Akin to how a birthing doula typically provides care, end-of-life doulas aim to bridge the gaps between the medical (AKA physical), emotional, and spiritual facets of death — both for patients and their families.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Waiting for the birth of a baby and waiting for a person to transition are very similar, as both require the doula to be fearless, patient, and calm," explains Ashley Johnson, an end-of-life doula and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Loyal Hands</a>. "We aim to enrich the dying experience for patients, family members, and friends while strengthening the relationship between medical and non-medical support."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This can include anything from physical companionship to the dying, planning funeral services on behalf of a grieving family, helping with household errands, and generally providing emotional support as needed, either in person or virtually. Though they often work with individuals who are terminally ill, end-of-life doulas are also sought out by those looking to plan for their own death, regardless of their current health situation or age. And their services aren't limited to humans — sometimes, they're even enlisted by millennials grieving the anticipated or actual loss of a pet (aka "starter children").</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's important to note that death doulas are not certified medical professionals, and the industry itself does not have one singular credentialing body; rather, there are many different death doula <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>training and certification courses</a> on the market. The National End-of-Life Doula Alliance (NEDA) also provides <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>six guiding principles </a>— including "empowerment" and "non-judgmental care" — which broadly defines the doula model of care.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Death doulas do not provide health care, but rather work in conjunction with palliative care and hospice using a multidisciplinary and integrated holistic approach," Johnson explains. "For many of us, our lives as death doulas are more of a calling than a profession; it's in our nature to be givers."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-normalizing-death-in-the-western-world></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Normalizing Death In the Western World</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whatever the case, the overall goal of a death doula remains the same: To normalize the experience of death for all parties involved — because death, just like birth, is a natural (and unavoidable) part of life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Johnson hopes that her work — and that of other end-of-life doulas — will help people to examine the complexities of death through a more positive lens. Or, at least examine death in the first place, rather than being addressed only after the fact. Johnson has aptly coined this concept the Death Positive Movement, which, in sum, promotes the idea that dying well should be viewed as a fundamental part of living well.</p><p>Whatever the case, the overall goal of a death doula remains the same: To normalize the experience of death for all parties involved.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"In many cultures throughout history, mental, spiritual, physical, and emotional support has been a fundamental part of the transition to death," Johnson explains. "Today, especially in Western culture, people tend to avoid discussions and even thinking about death."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Growing up in what she describes as a low socioeconomic neighborhood "that lacked advocacy on how to deal with end-of-life practices" was precisely what inspired Johnson to found Loyal Hands. "When death happened, families were not mentally, emotionally, [or] financially prepared."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Johnson thinks that the current global health crisis has forced people to change this mindset. "COVID-19 is a reminder for all of us that life can change in an instant," she says. "People are being forced to consider their mortality, and the reality is that it could come at any time. Death doulas help navigate the ongoing pandemic by controlling what can be controlled and [helping people] to let go of what cannot."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-generational-shift></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A Generational Shift</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another force for change: Millennials. Not only is it largely millennials who are going into this profession — the team of certified doulas at Loyal Hands is made up entirely of millennials — but so are the clients.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Samantha Halpern, a healthy 31-year-old living in Los Angeles, California, is one such example. "When I finally had assets and things that I would leave behind in an untimely death, I decided to request an appointment to create my own end-of-life directive," Halpern explains. "I was mostly motivated by the thought of my family, and what they would have to go through should I die, and [I] wanted to make things easier on them."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Halpern, who worked with Arthur and the team at Going with Grace, says that the experience changed her outlook on life. "Working with a death doula to plan for the end brings with it a certain and special appreciation for the life we're living now."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Maybe millennials as a whole are moving away from the constricts of generations past, such as organized religion and strict political divides, and are open to a more spiritually focused way of life. Maybe our curiosity about death stems from circumstance: Concerns about the environment, insufficient or unaffordable health care, global economic crashes, and viral pandemics. Maybe it has something to do with being the first generation to have increased access to such information — via the internet — during our formative years. Perhaps we're just more anxious about dying in general (can you really blame us?). Likely, it's some amalgam of all of the above.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As a millennial myself — and one who has experienced the loss of an immediate family member — I can say that, in hindsight, consulting with an end-of-life doula around the time of my mother's death certainly would have eased some of the burden, emotionally and logistically. Though we were fortunate to have endless support from friends and other family members, many of the actual end-of-life tasks — writing her obituary, planning the funeral service, boxing up all of her clothes and personal belongings and deciding where they should go — fell onto my sister and me. Without a doubt, it certainly would have been helpful to have another, objective, and well-trained set of hands on board.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Our culture overall is ready for an overhaul, particularly at our pain points: Birth, death, and access," Arthur argues wholeheartedly. "It is important that this generation and the ones to come are able to navigate the emotional, practical, legal, and spiritual issues while contemplating or nearing the end of life."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8OemK2gXZm8trjAZqSipJyau6%2B1wKWq</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./toby-keith-made-in-america-lyrics.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Toby Keith, Made in America Lyrics Uncovered</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stitches-rapper-wife-divorce-kids-height-net-worth-is-he-dead.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Stitches Rapper Wife, Divorce, Kids, Height, Net Worth, Is He Dead?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
