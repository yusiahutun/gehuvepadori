The pair stepped down from their positions as senior royals in January 2020 to be more “financially independent.” This was something which was accepted by <a href=#>Prince Harry’s </a>family, though it has since caused a lot of anguish for the duke. He has had strained relationships with Firm members such as his brother <a href=#>Prince William</a> after giving numerous interviews and releasing his memoir Spare last year.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1241072600-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-might-begin-to-struggle-financially-claims-author>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle might begin to struggle financially, claims author</h2><p>Tom explained how he thinks <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and her husband will struggle to fund themselves as they currently live in a $15 (£12 million) mansion in California which is said to have an $10 million mortgage. Despite having deals with streaming services such as <a href=#>Spotify</a>, which later ended.</p><p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle haven’t had much success with their work in recent months.</p><p>The pair have only created a few projects for <a href=#>Netflix</a>. This includes their docuseries Harry & Meghan and a documentary about the Invictus Games. However, Harry’s memoir Spare may have kept them afloat, but Bower doesn’t think it’s for too much longer.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Prince Harry may have another book ‘up his sleeve’ after ‘erasing details’ about William</a></p><p>He <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> Closer Magazine: “I think they are facing long-term, not immediately, but long-term financial challenges and they haven’t been able to reconcile that.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bower-criticizes-harry-and-meghan>Bower criticizes Harry and Meghan</h2><p>Appearing on Talk TV, Bower said Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s success had started to deplete, and they have “nothing left to offer.”</p><p>“The problem is, all they offer the American public is to trash our British royal family,” Bower said. “And their real problem now is that they’re gonna have to find a new act. And they just can’t find one. They’ve got nothing to deliver other than themselves, and they’re not particularly interesting anymore.”</p><p>He then called 42-year-old Meghan a “low-class, soap actress.”</p><p>“Her problem is she’s not a great actress. Her career ended long before she arrived in London. That’s why she came here. She couldn’t find any more work after Suits,” he claimed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-broadcaster-calls-bower-an-idiot>Broadcaster calls Bower an ‘idiot’</h2><p>The royal commentator was slammed by JJ Ansiobi, a journalist, on Talk TV. Ansiobi <a href=#>called Bower an “idiot” and said he “knows clearly nothing about Hollywood.”</a> This came after he made comments about Meghan’s acting career.</p><p>Defending the TV star, he said: “I won’t call him a misogynist ’cause he’s not mean to all women, just Meghan Markle.</p><p>“He knows clearly nothing about&nbsp;<a href=#>Hollywood</a>&nbsp;– stick to the royals Tom because you know nothing about how Hollywood works! Just because she’s signed to a new agency he thinks ‘Wow she should be working straight away.’ It’s not how it works.”</p><p>He continued talking about Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s success by saying: “The biggest players in Hollywood do not work continually flat-out nonstop. Actually, the people that are less successful who are trudging and trawling trying to get everything they can.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Prince Harry ‘wants to return’ but spilling ‘royal secrets’ may be a problem</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2aAcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GaYp5xdorKotMCnZKGZppp6r7vToaCnn12hsqfAjJqlnWWRp7Juv8KrmKaanJ67qHnFqKlmppWseqWxwKWqaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-swift-slut-shamed-for-having-relationships.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Swift Says She Was &amp;quot;Slut-Shamed&amp;quot; Just for Having Relationships</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nadya-suleman-brings-home-two-more-kids.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nadya Suleman Brings Home Two More Kids</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
