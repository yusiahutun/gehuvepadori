But how much will you need to build that house? This is one of the biggest questions at the back of the mind of most <a href=# rel=noopener>Kenya</a>ns who dream of building a home. Well, the cost of building a house in Kenya in 2024 varies depending on several factors.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a4162092e9820e7a.jpg><p class=align-left>Building a house is the ultimate dream of almost every individual. If you are going to build a new home, you may be wondering how much it would cost you. This is a difficult question to answer as there are a lot of factors to take into account when figuring out the construction cost. Usually, the cost of a finished home can be estimated based on the final design and building plan.</p><h2>Factors to determine the cost of building a house in Kenya</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/95550a6f28f73a23.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Airbnb Businesses in Kenya: Why They Are Thriving, Attracting Local Investors</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is essential to know how much it will cost to build your dream house. This way, you will be able to create a perfect house plan. The finishing of a house is the most expensive part. A quality finish will cost you around Ksh. 30,000 per square meter for a simple house and approximately Ksh. 60,000 per square meter for a luxurious house.</p><p class=align-left>You can build a house with as low as Ksh. 989,000 and above. A number of other factors determine the cost of building a house. Some of the factors include:</p><h3>1. The preferred location</h3><p class=align-left>Which area are you planning to build your house in? Well, the prices will differ based on whether it is an urban or a remote area. The cost of building a house in rural Kenya is lower when compared to that of urban areas. Do you own a plot already? If you have a plot already, it is much cheaper to build a house than a person planning to buy a plot.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ca874f923fda2f58.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 heaviest buildings in the world that you should know about</span></p></a><p class=align-left>For instance, the cost of buying a 1/8 acre of land in Nairobi is different depending on the location. In Kangundo, it will cost you about Ksh. 80,000 per 1/8 acre. You will need around Ksh. 3.5 million per 1/8 acre in Ruaka and about Ksh. 2 million per 1/8 acre in Syokimau. The prices will go up if you buy land in places like Runda and Karen.</p><p class=align-left>If you buy a plot, the secret is locating one in the desired area with a favourable climate and infrastructure. You should also consider the availability of utilities such as power as well as portable water.</p><h3>2. The type of building you want</h3><p class=align-left>When it comes to the type of building that you want, you need to consider several aspects such as the style, use, size, design, ownership, and performance aspects such as accessibility.</p><h3>3. Mechanical installations</h3><p class=align-left>When one hears about the mechanical installation of a building, what comes to their mind is the overall activities to be done, from the framework to the insulation of the building. It is advisable to think about the mechanical aspect of the building. This will prove a challenge to install or correct after the completion of the house.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2c7f3c9a40bed379.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is the cost of building a 2 bedroom house in rural Kenya</span></p></a><h3>4. Fittings</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/95550a6f28f73a23.png><p class=align-left>The fittings of a building include mirrors, curtains, bathroom fittings, fitted carpets, freestanding fridges, fitted kitchens, lighting fittings, and fitted cupboards. Note that the painting is not among the fittings.</p><h3>5. Types of joinery</h3><p class=align-left>Joinery is essential because it allows one to join two boards to create a solid fashion. Therefore, you will need to know the design of your house to determine the approximate cost of building a house. For instance, if you go for a wood house, you need to know the basic butt-joint, mitred butt-joint, half-lap joints, and tongue and groove joints.</p><h3>6. Specification of materials</h3><p class=align-left>What workmanship and materials do you need to develop the building? Specifications of materials include the drawings, quantities, and schedules for building a house. All these add up to the cost of the construction.</p><h3>7. Floor-to-ceiling heights</h3><p class=align-left>The more you request the ceiling height to be high, the more you should get prepared to dig deeper into your pocket. The most preferred ceiling size is approximately 7 feet to 9 feet because it makes a house appear smaller, less accommodating, and more cramped.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1463267a8ce48b3c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>3 bedroom house plans and cost in Kenya in 2024 (urban and rural rates)</span></p></a><h3>8. Site topography</h3><p class=align-left>Site topography will determine the base of the building to support it. If a site is flat, the topography may not influence the location and layout of the building, but on a sloping site, the topography is likely to be a significant design factor.</p><h3>9. Wall-to-floor ratio</h3><p class=align-left>The wall-to-floor ratio expresses the number of external walls per unit of floor area and thus is a critical measure of cost-efficiency. This ratio typically accounts for 15 to 25% of construction costs. There are some calculations that will be required to be done to determine the wall-to-floor ratio of your building which will cost a significant sum.</p><h2>Cost of building a two-bedroom house in Kenya</h2><p class=align-left>A 2-bedroom <a href=#>house </a>is perfect for small <a href=#>family</a> life.

The design, space, type of house, and a couple of other factors will determine the average cost of building a 3-bedroom house.</p><p class=align-left>Most people visit a person with a 3-bedroom house with the same features they desire for their house and inquire about the approximate cost of building it. Yes, it isn't easy to find a person with the same dream home design, but you can approximate the average cost of building a three-bedroom house using this method.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0c5417d978bd59e4.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Latest roofing designs in Kenya for a bungalow or mansionette</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You should always have the design of your living space in your mind. Imagine yourself in that designed house and do a lot of research before you start the process. The best thing is to pre-draw what you want. For example, most people who prefer a 3-bedroom house have a family and therefore think of the best design to fit the whole family.</p><p class=align-left>Most prefer the master bedroom to be more spacious than the rest of the bedrooms for kids or guests. One bathroom is enough, but you can have 2, one in the master bedroom and the other one for the kids or guests. You should also consider other special function rooms such as the dining room, the playing room, an office if desired, or a den.</p><p class=align-left>Furnishing the house will be more expensive, therefore you should have an impressive sum in your <a href=#>bank</a> account.

This is because the corners and angles will require intensive labour, not forgetting the fact that more materials will be required. The shape of the roof can also add or reduce the cost of building a <a href=#>house</a>.</p><p class=align-left>For instance, a dome-shaped roof requires more materials and labour. Are you aware that a kitchen is the most costly room to build? Well, it all depends on how spacious you want it to look.

Yes, one can refer to it as a semi-permanent home, but you can make it permanent by constructing it in a more modish design. The finishing touches, like fitting gypsum boards and tiles, are what make a mabati house have a modish appearance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f1959392f89614e5.jpg><p class=align-left>When we talk of mabati, it does not refer to the ones that are used for roofing.

The design, shape, and size are other factors that will increase the average cost of building such a structure. The mabati houses tend to have extreme temperatures and what people do is install Styrofoam, as it helps counter the temperatures.</p><p class=align-left>The good thing about a mabati house is that it can be completed in the shortest time possible.
