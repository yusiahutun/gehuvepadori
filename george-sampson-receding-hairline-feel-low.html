Appearing on Friday's <a class=hm-link href=#>This Morning</a>, the 24-year-old, who suffers from alopecia and a genetic condition, admitted that his receding hairline had left him "feeling low" as it had affected his career. "I still get hundreds of young men messaging me about their problems with hairlines and how low they get," he explained. "I wasn't that bad. For me it was more I still wanted to work in TV, do all these amazing things, because I've got a baby face I'll still play 16/17."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9573aac3788c-george-sampson-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=enohbp_FrLXF data-wc=12><strong>George Sampson has showed off the results of his third hair transplant</strong></p><p id=e2Sv1z6b_SoS data-wc=107>He added: "When my hairline was receding, it was almost impossible to get the work and because of that I was feeling low." Of his new transplant, George said: "I had this 12 weeks ago, it will double in thickness over the next three to six months." The TV star has since become a huge support to those going through the same thing. "It's been a real shock for me to listen to these guys," he added. "I ring a lot of them to help as much as I can. I say I'm willing to talk to you and tell you about my experiences and the procedures."</p><p id=eDJxJhegJAfz><a class=hm-link href=#>MORE: George Sampson shares picture of shaved head after 'successful' hair transplant</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/37d9c82166c3-george-sampson-this-morning-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ezxZepAUnvFQ data-wc=14><strong>Last year, the BGT star revealed he suffers from alopecia and a genetic condition</strong></p><p id=eeOWMjZqdJBS data-wc=99>Last year, George revealed footballer Wayne Rooney inspired him to undergo the £9,000 procedure after his hair started to thin from his head-spinning act. "Wayne Rooney – he was 25 [when he had the hair transplant]. He gave me a lot of confidence," he previously told hosts Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes. He explained that it wasn't all down to his dancing, saying: "There was more to it than head spinning. It started with genetics, my dad hasn’t got the greatest hairline but then everything I do, the stress-related illness, I was diagnosed with alopecia then the head spinning."</p><p id=eY4YJFo3Sir2><a class=hm-link href=#>STORY: Britain's Got Talent star George Sampson shows off results of two hair transplants</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaJ%2BaoaJkf3F9l2lsa21kbYZ0fo6gnKiql5p6tK3Mqaqopl2nsqSxw6KloGWYlrazuMinnGaelZq5brjOsGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-lopez-bedazzled-boots-courtside-8610239.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Lopez Wore Bedazzled Boots Courtside</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./23-astonishing-facts-about-phil-falcone.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>23 Astonishing Facts About Phil Falcone</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
