Where, it was all sort of part of this plan that was happening and unfolding through over months. It was months of that year," Combs said, looking back on her strained relationship with her Charmed castmates. "You were dating Julian [McMahon, who played half-demon Cole Turner]. So you guys were off in that world. Brian was off with Alyssa."</p><p>Combs revealed that it was just a year ago that she got an apology from Krause for what she experienced both on and off set as the <a href=#><strong>divide continued to grow</strong></a> among the trio, telling Doherty, "He just recently — it was about a year ago — in France, we were on stage at a panel that was filled with many, many people, and he just kind of paused."</p><p>She continued, "He looked at me like he forgot something, and I kind of looked at him like, 'What? What's the problem? Why are you looking at me like that? And he just looked at me while someone was asking a question and just went, 'I'm so sorry.'"</p><p>Confused, Combs said she asked him what he was sorry for before getting an explanation and an apology from Krause -- one that was 24 years in the marking.</p><p>"And I was like, 'Sorry for what?' I was like, 'Are you going somewhere? What's happening?' He just shook his head, and he goes, 'I'm so sorry,'" Combs explained. "Because we had talked a little about it on stage without talking about it. Because still no one was allowed to talk about it."</p><p>The Pretty Liars alum said Krause continued to apologize long after the panel was over.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d2c79495-bebb-416b-868f-efd4774745b7 data-container-ref=toofab:article:fa39f6f3-5a83-4d57-abad-cc6410deb96a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a1/5by4/2023/12/19/a1627f2a0e91438aabd9006cc098bfcd_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Holly Marie Combs Claims Alyssa Milano Gave Ultimatum to Get Shannen Doherty Fired from Charmed</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"And we got off stage, and he just looked at me and said, 'I'm so sorry. That must have been a terrible time for you,'" she added.</p><p>In part one of the podcast, Combs revealed that Doherty didn't quit the series, as was reported in the time. Instead, she claims the Beverly Hills, 90210 star was fired because <a href=#><strong>Milano gave producers an ultimatum</strong></a> ...her or me.</p><p>Combs said she went straight to the source, show producers Jonathan Levin, in the early 2000s to find out the real story behind Doherty's departure.</p><p>"He said, 'We didn't mean to, but we've been backed into this corner. We're basically in this position where it's one or the other,'" said Combs. "'We were told [by Milano] it's her or [Doherty] and Alyssa has threatened to sue us for a hostile workplace environment.'"</p><p>Combs further claimed that Milano had been documenting "every time she felt uncomfortable on set," as if she was building a case against Combs and Doherty. She further said that while there might have been some friction between the ladies, she'd never witnessed anything significant, so it came as a huge surprise.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:7f4a00ba-2b9e-46c8-a4ca-f7c578cb0092 data-container-ref=toofab:article:fa39f6f3-5a83-4d57-abad-cc6410deb96a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/82/5by4/2023/12/11/8269ddf4973340f184abb3b8c3ec7127_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Shannen Doherty Claims Alyssa Milano Caused 'Weird Divide' Between Her and Holly Marie Combs</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In fact, she said no crew or guest stars or anyone really noticed, so far as she knows. "It was all behind the scenes," she said. "There's not a director that wouldn't work with you again. There's not a crew member that didn’t have a great time working with you. So by today's standards, it wouldn't f--king fly."</p><p>When it came down that Doherty was leaving the show, Combs said she wanted to walk away with her longtime friend. "She didn't want to do it without me," Combs recalled saying at the time. "Therefore, I don't want to do it without her and that should be fairly clear."</p><p>Unfortunately, per Combs, Levin threatened to sue her if she quit the show, which she said felt like "blackmail" at the time, and so she stayed as McGowan came on the show. Combs would remain with the show alongside Milano and McGowan until its conclusion after eight seasons.</p><p>TooFab has reached out to Milano's reps for comment.</p><a id=gallery-link-23c11957-062e-4e54-8097-fcd6881e4525 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:23c11957-062e-4e54-8097-fcd6881e4525 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:fa39f6f3-5a83-4d57-abad-cc6410deb96a data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/86/4by3/2023/12/19/86647af651f244af8117fd3b16a99161_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGtmanFfnbytuNhmpJqqmZp6pLvMm6pmnZ2kwaq7zZqjpbFdp7Kku9Snq6xlkaW8rbvGsmSsoJVitLDAjJ%2BpqKVdmLWivsyem2abn6jBor6Ma2tmsZWWv7R5wJ%2Brnqpdlrm6v9KaZKahnJa7sHnFnqydZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./noel-gallaghers-ex-wife-meg-23601438.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Noel Gallagher's ex wife Meg Mathews strips totally naked days before turning 55</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brian-kleinschmidt.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Brian Kleinschmidt Bio, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Wiki</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
