Morocco Weighed 8 lbs., 13 oz., and measured 19 inches long at birth. Reports say he looked so angelic that he was described as a sweet and tranquil baby.</p><p>Mike Tyson’s representative told PEOPLE magazine, “Mike and Kiki are overjoyed to welcome their precious son into the family. Morocco’s parents weren’t the only ones thrilled at his birth. The entire Tyson fan club took a liking to the young lad and has watched him grow.</p><p>We take a look into the life of this 12-year-old.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Capture-fotor-20230625192647.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Morocco_Tyson_Kids_Choice_Award></span>Morocco Tyson Kids Choice Award<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While most celebrity kids shy away from the limelight, Morocco seems not to mind, and neither do his parents, to an extent. In 2018, Morocco appeared on the Kids Choice Award orange carpet alongside his parents, biological sister Milian, and half-brother Miguel. The family had fun taking pictures while their father doted on his kids.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Morocco_Tysons_Half-Siblings></span>Morocco Tyson’s Half-Siblings&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Morocco is the youngest in the Tyson family, making him the seventh child with six older siblings. Of all his father’s children, Milian is the only child who comes from Morocco’s mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Morocco’s eldest half-sibling Mikey was born in 1990. She is a product of Mike Tyson’s first marriage to Mikey Lorna Tyson.&nbsp;Rayna, also known as Ramsay Tyson, born on February 14, 1996, and her brother Amir born in August 1997, are Morocco’s second and third older siblings from his father’s second marriage to Monica Turner.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Capture3-fotor-20230625193524.jpg><p>Miguel and Exodus came from Mike Tyson’s relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Sol Xochitl. Sadly, Exodus, Morocco’s second older sister, is late. She died at 4 in 2009, long before Morocco was born and his father even met his mother. Exodus was caught in a treadmill cord in her Phoenix home and died after she was rushed to a local hospital.&nbsp;</p><p>According to reports, Miguel, Tyson’s first son and Exodus elder brother, found her tangled up in the treadmill cord. According to ABC News, while playing, Exodus accidentally got entangled in the treadmill cord, which police described as acting like a noose.</p><p>Despite immediate efforts by her mother to rescue her and perform CPR, Exodus was unresponsive. Mike Tyson was informed of the situation and rushed to the hospital in Phoenix, where Exodus was on life support. Despite the medical team’s efforts, Exodus passed away at St. Joseph’s Hospital and Medical Centre.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_Morocco_Tysons_Sisters_Death_an_Accident></span>Was Morocco Tyson’s Sister’s Death an Accident?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Following a thorough investigation by the Phoenix Police, it was determined that Exodus’ death was a tragic accident. According to Sgt. Andy Hill, she was playing on a treadmill when her head became entangled in a cord loop, rendering her unable to free herself.</p><p>The mother immediately called 911, describing her baby being choked. Mike Tyson expressed gratitude for the prayers and support he received at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/8b313e9c9681aa06262ceab7271fcbe7.jpg><p>The incident prompted Consumer Reports to emphasize the importance of treadmill safety, describing the death as preventable. Mike Tyson referred to Exodus as his “Angel” and revealed to Oprah Winfrey that he chose not to know the details of her passing.</p><p>He went on to describe that his first thought after he received the news was that it was a tragedy. According to him, he was grateful he found a way to mourn his daughter without sinking back into his demons.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Morocco_Tyson_and_Mike_Tysons_Relationship></span>Morocco Tyson and Mike Tyson’s Relationship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mike Tyson loves his children. However, the former boxer seems fond of his last two kids, Morocco. We have seen the renowned boxer pose in several pictures with Morocco, and the father-son bond is powerful. Based on Mike Tyson’s Instagram handle last year, they are <a href=#>golf </a>buddies.&nbsp;</p><p>Morocco doesn’t just share this beautiful bond with his father; he also shares a beautiful relationship with his mother. The beautiful pictures of Morocco and his mother online go a long way to prove this.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Morocco_Tysons_Mother></span>Who Is Morocco Tyson’s Mother?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Morocco’s mother is Lakiha Spicer Tyson. She is a fashion entrepreneur who married Morocco’s father in 2009. Lakiha was a Muslim but followed the Christian faith following her marriage to Mike Tyson.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Capture2-fotor-20230625193320.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Morocco_Tyson_Instagram></span>Morocco Tyson Instagram<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Unlike many celebrity kids who are hardly fond of social media, Morocco Tyson has his own verified <a href=#>Instagram </a>account with 5000+ followers managed by his parents. They frequently share adorable photos and videos of him engaging in tennis and boxing and meeting with famous sportspeople like&nbsp;Kylian Mbappe. Morocco is somewhat of an Instagram celebrity.&nbsp;</p><p>Morocco enjoys a privileged lifestyle that is beyond the reach of most people’s imagination. With his father’s substantial net worth estimated at over $3 million, Morocco’s future is full of possibilities, and only time will reveal whether he will follow in his father’s footsteps to become a boxing great or pursue other passions.</p><p>Another celebrity kid who has the public eye on him is Lil Wayne’s son <a href=#>Dwayne Carter III</a>. Dwayne shut down the internet with hot rap verses leaving many amazed at his talent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kurC%2BzpyaqGWkrsCwuoymnJ6sXaK2rLGMrbCsp56oerq71KeenqukYsCwuo4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./trish-stratus.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Trish Stratus - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Married, Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./joanna-gaines-shares-newly-decorated-living-room-in-video.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Joanna Gaines Shares Newly Decorated Living Room in Video</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
