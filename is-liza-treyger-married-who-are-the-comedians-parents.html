She uses humor to make her daily pitfalls and anxieties relatable and laughable. That means she’s also open about her dating life — though most of it comes as humor.</span></p><p><span>So, what’s actually going on in Liza’s life? Is the comedian married? And who are her parents who wanted her to get married? Find answers as you scroll down.</span></p><h3><b>Is Liza Treyger Married?</b></h3><p><span>No, as of 2023, Liza Treyger isn’t married. In fact, she might be leading a single life — no commitments, just partying. “I’m pretty dirty, and right now I’m in a phase where I’m talking a lot about how much I party and have sex and stuff,” she shared.</span></p><p><span>The comedian also often talked a lot about her dating life on her shows. If you want to learn more about her perceptive on relationships, check out her podcast “Putting Faith in Your Love Life” with Nicole Byer. There, the duo also talks about how their religious and spiritual beliefs helped to shape their relationships.</span></p><p><span>Now, for those of you looking forward to impressing Liza, know that she loves late 90’s and early 2000’s pop and soul music. She enjoys collaging, shopping, walking around NYC, private pools, chatting with friends, and fighting with enemies – but mostly spending money, telling jokes, and giggling with girlfriends.</span></p><p><span>Also, here’s a little detail on how she got into stand-up comedy. Officially, it was back in 2008 that she was invited by “some dude” to go watch him at an open mic at a coffee shop, and while she was watching the other people, she thought, “I think I can do this.”</span></p><p><span>The next thing she knew, she was up on the stage, cracking people up.&nbsp; Thereafter, she came back every week, and soon she started doing it every day. “It was an accident, I wasn’t raised as a comedy fan or knew about stand-up comedy,” she explained. “I remember putting on an improv show in high school. For class projects, I’d always try to do a movie or a sketch, so I feel like I always wanted to do something fun, but I didn’t find my true happiness until standup.”</span></p><h3><b>Who Are Liza Treyger Parents?</b></h3><p><span>Liza Treyger shared that her Russian parents are “foreign, foreign, foreign.” They wanted her to get married, have kids, and settle down. But here she is, often joking about “relationships, sex, and stuff.” No wonder, the comedian didn’t want her parents to be there at her shows.</span></p><p><span>So far, her dad has only seen her perform once, and her mother, thrice. “And that was more than three or four years ago. They’ve watched me on TV and know my dirty comedy. But they don’t speak English that well,” she shared. In fact, they were so “old and foreign” that as a child in first and second grade, Liza knew just as much as they did about the American culture.</span></p><p><span>However, she does want to make her parents laugh. “When I write a joke that translates well and my parents laugh I get really proud, but I don’t think they get all of my jokes,” the comedian added.</span></p><p><span>Overall, Liza has an enormous respect for her parents. She’s convinced that her father and mother have done “amazing things” — bringing a teen and a young toddler to a foreign land with no job, no knowledge of the language, and starting all over again.</span></p><p><span>This is also why Liza didn’t make fun of her parents on her shows. “Ha ha, they don’t speak English, how funny!” I just respect them so much [to do that],” she said.&nbsp; “So I am waiting until I’m more mature as a comic to really be able to write the jokes that I want to write about them.”</span></p><p><span>Talking about her sibling, Liza has a sister named Alex Treyger who was born on &nbsp; Apr 9, 1977. She lived in Chicago, Illinois with her husband and their kids.</span></p><p><span>Other members of Liza’s family include Rimma, Dina, and Olga Treyger.</span></p><h3><b>Liza Treyger Height</b></h3><p><span>Liza Treyger stands tall at a height of above 5 feet 6 inches (167 cm).</span></p><p><span>Her distinct features include — brown eyes and hair and a healthy body.</span></p><h3><b>Liza Treyger Net Worth</b></h3><p><span>Liza Treyger garnered a net worth of under $800 thousand by 2023 — all thanks to her time as a stand-up comedian and actress. So far, Liza has graced six TV shows including </span><i><span>Survival of the Thickest</span></i><span>, and has performed stand-ups for over 16 years! The comedian has also graced the </span><i><span>Just for Laughs</span></i><span> Festival, and Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and has done hour specials with Comedy Central and Netflix.</span></p><p><span>On top of that, she hosted multiple podcasts such as Name Dropping, That’s Messed Up, and Enemies.</span></p><p><span>The thing she loves the most about her job is the freedom. “I can say yes or no to whatever I want and say what I want. I owe nobody nothing,” she shared.</span></p><p><span>Prior to starting a comedy career, Liza used to be a PE teacher.</span></p><p><span>She has a bachelor’s degree from </span><i><span>North Park University</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>How Old Is Liza Treyger?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Liza Treyger was born on August 31, 1987.
