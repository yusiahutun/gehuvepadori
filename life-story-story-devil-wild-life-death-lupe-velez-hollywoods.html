She was also pregnant, no doubt suffered from bipolar, and left behind a life papered in tabloid headlines and scandal.</p><p>Yet, what should have been an international tragedy –&nbsp;a wake-up call to the media around the fragility of celebrity and mental health –&nbsp;was soon turned into farce by underground filmmaker Kenneth Anger. He published Hollywood Babylon, a widely-sold compendium of Tinseltown’s juiciest rumours that could these days easily be mistaken for National Enquirer prose (“a luscious plum of sizzling scandal that continues to shock the world” reads its Amazon sell), which crudely – and falsely –&nbsp;revised Vélez’s death for laughs.&nbsp;</p><p>Anger maintained&nbsp;that Vélez had in fact drowned in her own toilet bowl, after the barbiturates had interfered with her digesting dinner, causing her to run to the bathroom, fall, and knock her head on the side of the toilet. He wrote, with bathetic relish: “In this shrine to her own death, La Lupe, gowned in silver lamé, pencilled a farewell note to the father of her fetus, opened a bottle of Seconal, and swallowed 75 of the little buggers.</p><p>“She lay down on the bed, hands clasped in prayer, in what she envisioned as a final photo of exquisite beauty. That photo was never to be taken. The Seconal did not go down well with her spicy Last Supper. She puked, leaving a trial of vomit from the bed to the bathroom, where she slipped on the tiles and plunged headfirst into the toilet. Juanita, the chambermaid, discovered her mistress's corpse later that morning. The tableau was neither pretty nor vivant.”</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>'My life is the story of a devil'</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Hulton Archive</span></figure><p>Despite Anger&nbsp;flippantly explaining his theory as “mental telepathy” (ergo: nonsense, her death report citing Seconal, not drowning), his story became urban legend and sunk deep into the nooks and crannies of popular culture. It featured on an episode of <a href=#>The Simpsons </a>in 1997, the NBC sitcom Frasier, and a short film by Andy Warhol starring Edie Sedgwick as Vélez. Her life twisted and trivialised, Vélez <a href=#>is one of the tabloids' very first casualties</a>.</p><p>Tragically, her life exists now as a salacious footnote to a bygone era, rather than a cautionary tale, and many more celebrities have been tortured by the tabloids&nbsp;since: from Jade Goody to Amy Winehouse and<a href=#> Caroline Flack</a>.&nbsp; Their legacies – further stained by pockets of evil on the internet, from Instagram comments to gossip sites and Reddit threads – never recovered. So often, these&nbsp;are women who couldn't be contained; women moved against the grain and had something to say. Just like Lupe Vélez.</p><p>Yet, proving all reputations are complicated, Vélez&nbsp;wasn't altogether blameless.&nbsp;"My life story? It is the story of a devil,” Velez once said. “And who wants to print the story of a devil? I am wild, I cannot help it."</p><p>The dancer and actress from San Luis, Mexico, had made a name for herself in America as the first non-white star to front a Hollywood film franchise, the popular 1940s Mexican Spitfire comedy series (its humour now draws parallels to <a href=#>Modern Family</a>) about a hot-headed Mexican singer (Vélez) navigating New York for the first time.&nbsp;</p><span></span><p>While just five feet tall, Vélez was strikingly beautiful, with pencilled eyebrows drawn starkly across her powdered face like two railway arches, black hair shiny as a crow’s back, her expression perpetually hung between a wink and a smile. Beginning as a vaudeville dancer in Mexico before moving to Los Angeles after Richard Bennnett needed a Mexican cantina singer in his play The Dove, Vélez became known for her sensuality and temper.&nbsp;</p><p>After breaking through with a leading role in Douglas Fairbanks'&nbsp;silent adventure film The Gaucho in 1927 and then an episode of Laurel & Hardy (Sailors, Beware!), Vélez landed in Hollywood like a flamingo amongst pigeons. Tabloids latched onto her as an exotic curio: loud, sexual, wild, untamable. “When she puckers up her lips, it’s impossible to tell if she is going to kiss you, bite you, or spit on you!” was word around the studio during the making of The Gaucho.&nbsp;</p><p>Broadsheets were selective in their reporting and the words they used to describe the star. The New York Times printed a story about how&nbsp;10,000 fans almost “ripped the clothes off her back”, when Vélez visited Mexico City in 1937, suffering her “scratches and bruises” (and when she died the headline described as as the “tempestuous Lupe Vélez”). Often, editors would muddy her interviews with mistakes so that it seemed as if she could barely speak English, despite the fact she was fluent, and her name was swapped for a whole host of demeaning nicknames: Mexican Kitten, The Hot Tamale, Mexican Hurricane, The Mexican Madcap, The Mexican Wildcat and Whoopee Lupe.</p><p>Vélez may have been making over $2,000 dollars a week (that’s $30,000 today) as one of Hollywood’s most bankable, recognised stars, but it seemed as if the industry was determined for her to remain other. Even on screen, she was typecast, and her cultural differences poked fun of. A scene from Mexican Spitfire film The Girl From Mexico sees her at a cycling race with a&nbsp;male partner, who spits out his champagne in grimaced shock and covers his ears as she shouts and cheers on the Mexican cyclist with excitement.</p><p>“Her ethnicity was played up for her films, and, for the sake of her 'public image'&nbsp;she fell into that characterization, both on and off screen,” writes Vélez biographer Michelle Vogel in her book Lupe Vélez: The Life and Career of Hollywood’s Mexican Spitfire.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>'Too loud, too colourful'</span></figure><p>Reports about Vélez’s personal life were circulated by the tabloids monthly: Vélez went to parties with no underwear on&nbsp;(“she was innocent of lingerie”, Anger would also later write in Hollywood Babylon), was linked romantically to Charlie Chaplin, feuded with rival female performers (going as far as to give Libby Holman a black eye after she punched her in the face), and kept a knife strapped to her garter. Gossip columnists constantly remarked on her “loud voice”, her “loud clothes” and her aggressive nature.&nbsp;</p><p>“She was, most likely, undiagnosed bipolar,” said Vogel in an interview about her book. “Hollywood, with all of its luxuries and trappings, only served to heighten her personality. She was always manic, extremely high-strung. As a result of her moods, she had knock-down, drag-out fights with the men in her life, and even with some of her female co-stars.”</p><p>The problem was, while the tabloids were relentless in their invasive reporting, and certainly put a spin on the truth, Vélez was aggressive. She really did keep a knife in her garter, and once pulled it out when threatening to slit Norma Shearer’s throat at a ball hosted by Carole Lombard, just because the actress had worn red when the dress code had been all-white. She was renowned for attending Friday night boxing matches at the Hollywood Legion Stadium and screaming at the fighters; once even beating the referee with her umbrella after she disagreed with his verdict.&nbsp;</p><p>Vélez’s love life was the most contentious story of all, narrated by the tabloids with as much detail and regularity as a soap opera. She was known to leap-frog constantly from one leading man to another, blowing each relationship up in smoke as headlines reported on domestic abuse and cheating scandals. “The first time you buy a house you think how pretty it is and sign the check. The second time you look to see if the basement has termites. It's the same with men,” she famously quipped during an interview.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>A violent love: Lupe Vélez and Gary Cooper in 1929</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Topical Press Agency</span></figure><p>One of her first Hollywood relationships was with her The Wolf Song (1929) co-star<a href=#> Gary Cooper</a>, whom she cut so badly with a knife during one domestic he required stitches. The provocation? He had drawn a smiley face on one of her nipples.</p><p>Vélez exercarbated the intrigue in her interviews, chillingly telling one fanzine, “I think I will kill my Gary, because he does not get angry when Lupe is angry with him.” Eventually Cooper left her, and was ordered by Paramount Studios to take a holiday on account of his nervous exhaustion and 45-pound weight loss considered a result of his relationship. The day he boarded the train to get away, Vélez ran onto the platform, smashed the glass of his window pane and tried to shoot him with her pistol while reportedly shouting, “Gary! You son of a bitch!”</p><p>A brief marriage to Tarzan star Johnny Weissmuller followed suit in October 1933, and the bruises and love bites they both sported as a result of their “passionate lovemaking” were regularly noted in the press (and commented on by makeup artists on the Tarzan films, whose task it was to cover Weissmuller’s up), as were their public fights. “For no reason, I punch him right on the nose. He rears up and says, ‘Mama, you hit me,’ and I say, ‘Darling, I am so sorry. Hit me right back,’" Vélez said in an interview during the marriage.</p><p>One of the most notorious tales picked up by the tabloids during this time was that Vélez had killed Weissmuller’s dog. She’d apparently poisoned it after becoming enraged with how much attention the pup received compared to her. Weissmuller retaliated by breaking Velez’s parrot’s neck, which he in turn despised for the fact it always called him Gary, the parrot having been acquired during Cooper's tenure as lover. During her six-year marriage with Weissmuller, Vélez&nbsp;filed for divorce three times citing cruelty, the third time finally ending their marriage in 1939. She would later tell a magazine: “In a church, I am a saint. In a public place, I am a lady. In my own home, I am a devil...My house is where I can do as I please, scream and yell and dance and fall on the floor if I like. I am myself when I am in my home.”</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Lupe Vélez and Johnny Weissmuller, not yet married, at the El Mirador Hotel in Palm Springs, 1932</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Bettmann</span></figure><p>Vélez is far from the victim in these stories, but a certain amount of empathy and context – as with any story – is necessary. Biographers have been keen to point out, for instance, her proximity to violence from a young age. Vélez’s father was a colonel who fought in the Mexican Revolution, and he often brought her out on missions as a child, of which she kept disturbing memories.</p><p>“I saw the horse of my brother shot beneath him...many mens try and kill my father. I see my father kill other peoples,” she said during one interview, explaining how it affected her childhood friendships. “I had to play with boys. Girls found me too rough.”</p><p>It was perhaps this instinct that allowed her to break through Hollywood’s institutional sexism and racism to become one of Mexico’s most famous faces. But holding onto her own near-mythologised legacy proved draining. It's a legacy that continues to suffer from hyperbole, with Floyd Conner writing in his 1993 biography of the star that Vélez was born the day a violent rainstorm ripped through her hometown of San Luis.&nbsp;</p><p>“People think I like to fight,” Vélez once told her best friend Estelle Taylor. “I have to fight for everything. I’m so tired of it all. Ever since I was a baby I’ve been fighting.” It seemed like Hollywood, and the press, wanted to preserve Vélez's anger. Like spectators at a bullfight, there was no fun to be had in watching a plaything go limp.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Lupe Vélez and her husband Johnny Weissmuller on holiday in October 1933&nbsp;</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: John Kobal Foundation</span></figure><p>“Another misconception is that she was a loose woman…” said Vogel. (In Hollywood Babylon Kenneth Anger described her “going through a small army of lover – cowboys, stuntmen, and American gigolos.”)&nbsp;“Sure, she loved to party and have a good time, but she was fiercely loyal to her men. She was committed to Gary Cooper and Johnny Weissmuller for almost 10 years of her life. She helped everyone and supported her extended family in Mexico for much of her life,” continued Vogel.&nbsp;Indeed, it was reported that Vélez kept her personal phone number listed so that fans could call her up and chat when they were in distress. She also had a big heart, keeping a large menagerie of rescue animals which included horses, monkeys, canaries, turtles and dogs.</p><p>It is also likely that Vélez – just as Marilyn Monroe years after her – suffered from serious mental health disorders. Academic Rosa-Linda Fregoso&nbsp;wrote in her book From Bananas to Buttocks: The Latina Body in Popular Film and Culture that she displayed signs of extreme mania and depression throughout her career. It was reported that when she came second in a Los Angeles talent show for instance, Vélez was so distraught she threatened to commit suicide. Naturally, three local newspapers grossly exaggerated the story, saying she had shot herself in the temple and was 'on the brink of death'. In fact, Velez had cut one of her wrists, lightly, in the company of several people.</p><p>Fregoso also speculates that Vélez’s fatal overdose took place during a bipolar episode. The illness was barely understood by medical professionals let alone the public, and did not even enter the&nbsp; American Psychiatric Association’s (APA) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) until its third revision in 1980.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Charlie Chaplin met Vélez early on in her career, and here he accompanies her to a movie premiere in 1928</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Archive Photos</span></figure><p>It is said that&nbsp;Vélez, always aware of eyes on her back,&nbsp;staged a "beautiful suicide". The flowers, the candles and the make-up were all meticulously planned. By her side also lay two suicide notes. One was addressed to fledgling actor and her most recent lover Harald Raymond, who had apparently refused to marry her.&nbsp;Vélez, a devout Catholic, could not bring herself to have an abortion, nor birth an illegitimate child.</p><p>It read: “To Harald, May God forgive you and forgive me too, but I prefer to take my life away and our baby's before I bring him with shame or killing him. – Lupe.”</p><p>On the back of the note, Vélez wrote:</p><p>“How could you, Harald, fake such a great love for me and our baby when all the time, you didn't want us? I see no other way out for me, so goodbye, and good luck to you, Love Lupe.”</p><p>The second note was addressed to her secretary, asking for her to tend to her two dogs, Chips and Chops.</p><p>The following evening, the Hollywood Legion Stadium shone a spotlight on Vélez's empty ringside seat, and the following week, 4,000 people came to walk past her casket at her funeral in Beverly Hills.</p><p>Fifteen years later, Anger published Hollywood Babylon.</p><p>If only he had quoted this:</p><p>“Although the public thinks that I'm a very wild girl. Actually I'm not. I'm just me, Lupe Vélez, simple and natural Lupe.&nbsp;If I'm happy, I dance and sing and acted like a child. And if something irritates me, I cry and sob. Someone called that 'personality'. The Personality is nothing more than behave with others as you really are. If I tried to look and act like Norma Talmadge, the great dramatic actress, or like Corinne Griffith, the aristocrat of the movies, or like Mary Pickford, the sweet and gentle Mary, I would be nothing more than an imitation. I just want to be myself: Lupe Vélez .”</p><h4><strong>Read more:</strong></h4><p><a href=#>Why we love to hate celebrities, and why it has to stop</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaJ6Zobq0e49oo6KelWLAtbvRsmSsrJ%2Bnxm6wxK%2BgpWWnnrmlecuinZ5llJqutbSMpaypnV2rsq2x2WafqKScrsSwu8OsZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./andy-adler.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Andy Adler dating?
