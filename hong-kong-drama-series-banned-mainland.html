He said a similar order was issued to TVB's other licensed online video providers on the mainland. 'TVB is concerned about the matter. It is waiting for an official notice before making any comment,' the source said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The ban comes as Sarft starts to limit the number of televised entertainment programmes and replace them with 'moral preaching' programmes from next year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A source at sohu.com confirmed that episodes of the TVB drama were removed from its website yesterday. Along with other mainland video providers, sohu.com paid TVB a fee for the right to show the series. The exact reason for the ban was not immediately apparent, but the series is known for its controversial storyline, which features cannibalism. It has low ratings but draws a cult following among young viewers in Hong Kong, where it is still being shown. It is one of the most discussed TV series in the online community.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The series is popular among young viewers on the mainland because of its A-list cast including actors such as Bowie Lam, Moses Chan and Charmaine Sheh.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The ban has baffled fans north of the border because the series makes no direct reference to contemporary affairs on the mainland. Most people believe it is due to the depiction of cannibalism, which the censor may have deemed inappropriate.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many viewers criticised Sarft for inconsistency, with one mainland blogger asking: 'If they think the drama has problems, why did they ban it halfway through?'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The series, which began airing last month, centres on the lives of three former band members after a tragic adventure in Xinjiang 18 years previously left them trapped in snowy mountains. The three kill and eat the flesh of a fellow band member in order to survive. The story tells how they are haunted by guilt and struggle to come to terms with their lives.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Apart from the cannibal scene that regularly appears in flashbacks, the story portrays a bleak view of humanity. Characters in the drama cheat each other and enter into casual sexual relationships.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A mainland commentator said it was popular because it was not the usual type of Hong Kong TV drama, which often focuses on a family feud or love story, rather than touching upon the dark side of human nature.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A quote in the series that 'this city is dying, you know?' has become a Facebook hit phrase for young people disillusioned with Hong Kong society.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A search for Chinese titles of When Heaven Burns on the video sub-site of Baidu, the largest search engine on the mainland, last night found nothing but a line saying the phrase 'could involve content that is in breach of relevant laws and policies'.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jonathan Chik, the drama's director, said on Facebook: 'Who can stop the wheel of times from moving forward? When Heaven Burns is so far reaching that its impact is beyond what we expected. No one should give up showing the remaining episodes, now it's coming to an end.'</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdpbYV3f5hon6iml2K4sLrGZpurmZ2WerSx0aKcrGWSlruvscNmpJqhnqGur7A%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./miley-cyrus-celebrities-reveal-when-they-lost-their-virginity.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Miley Cyrus, 23 Other Celebrities Reveal When They Lost Their Virginity</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./first-aid-10-must-have-items-fix-any-emergency.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 Must-Have Items to Fix Any Fashion Emergency</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
