In an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the 45-year-old actress opened up about feeling “objectified” on sets after being continually tricked to film nude scenes without her consent.</p><p>In a roundtable conversation with other leading actresses, such as <strong>Elisabeth Moss</strong> and <strong>Sandra Oh</strong>, Newton revealed that, before “Westworld,” directors have often told her that they were filming her from the bust up—only to discover later that her entire body was exposed. Though a majority of her scenes on “Westworld” are nude, Newton explained that she was drawn to the show, in which she plays an android in an amusement park, because her character’s nudity wasn’t sexualized.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DVFxtargetreview.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/askawitch_question4_FI.jpg><p><span>“That’s why I took the show. I’ve been objectified,” Newton said. “I’ve had directors lie to me when I’m in a naked situation on a movie and been told that they’re cutting here (motions to her bust line and up) when in fact they’re shooting from here (motions to whole body), so you see everything. I</span><span>‘ve had terrible things happen, so to be able to say to the showrunners of ‘Westworld,’ ‘I am willing to stand for 75 percent of this season totally naked” because it wasn’t a sexual context [is powerful].'”</span></p><p>However, the nudity in “Westworld” hasn’t only been enlightening for Newton. The actress revealed that the show, which also requires several male characters to disrobe on camera, has also been a learning experience for men who now understand what it’s like to be a woman and expose themselves onscreen.</p><p><span>“To see this man terrified of being naked when Evan Rachel Wood and I have grown accustomed to it, sitting there, having a chat, a glass of water, totally naked, it was very touching,” Newton said. “He’s learned that it’s really tough…Men are also really worried about how their bodies look. So much more worried than us. Like these guys on ‘Westworld’ are all, ‘How does my bum look? I’m really scared. Can you do some shading here and there?’ And we’re like, ‘Really?'”</span></p><p>Newton’s words are proof that she’s both an inspiration onscreen and off.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmK6sMLInqpob2NpgXJ9jq2fmqaUnrJuusSwq6imXam%2Fqq%2FKnptmpqWZsm6%2Fwp6lnqtf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amazon-essential-sweats-cyber-monday-sale-2022-6832981.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>These Amazon Essentials Sweat Pants Are Just $12 for Cyber Monday</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./saunas-exhausting-workout-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Saunas can be 'as exhausting as a workout'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
