She additionally revealed that she got her first tattoo when she was in the seventh grade. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The makeup artists later revealed that the actress arrived on set at around 3:30 in the morning, and it took them about 12-14 hours every day to cover her tattoos with makeup.</p><p>They apparently had to do it to make her ready for filming — since she couldn't appear onscreen with tattoos all over her body.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The actress also shared that the reason why none of her fans saw her tattoos was because she used&nbsp;a lot of makeup to cover them up. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The video went viral on the internet — because she came out with her tattoos for the first time — with many inquiring, "are <a href=# rel=follow>Kristen Bell</a>'s tattoos real?" <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>The Viral Video Was Just a Skit</h2><p>Well, it turns out the viral video, made by the Funny or Die team, was just a comedy skit,&nbsp;with the 41-year-old actress acting in a fake behind-the-scenes interview setup.</p><p>In reality, none of the tattoos shown in the video were real. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In April 2016, while appearing on a Wired video to answer some of the internet's most searched questions about her, Bell confirmed that she did not have any tattoos on her body. After saying that, the Frozen actress added that she, however,&nbsp;always wanted to get one.</p><p>"I've always wanted a tattoo, but my husband does not like girls with tattoos," she jokingly said, mentioning her spouse, Dax Shepard.
