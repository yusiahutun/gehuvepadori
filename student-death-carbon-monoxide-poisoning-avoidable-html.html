heard it. Each moment represented a step in the chain when Mr Hill's death might have been averted.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'His death was a tragic example of the dangers of carbon monoxide in general and the dangers of mobile gas cabinet heaters in particular. There is a suite of advice and guidance publicly available in this regard.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The sheriff added: 'These heaters should never be placed in bathrooms or shower rooms where the water vapour and steam can compromise combustion.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'They should be placed in rooms of sufficient volume with purpose-provided ventilation.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sheriff Brown passed on his 'deepest sympathies and condolences' to the Hill family.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A spokesman for Burghill Farms said: 'We express our heartfelt condolences again to Thomas Hill's family and to the Beard family and hope the fatal accident inquiry and previous court proceedings have given them some comfort and answers.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'On our part, we genuinely believed at the time of Thomas' death, suitable gas safety measures were in place as the tenant who had taken responsibility for letting the cottage had arranged regular inspections by an engineer and this position is reflected in the inquiry's determination.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'At the time, we were unaware of certain aspects of complex gas safety regulations but had we been made aware that the engineer appointed to carry out the checks on the gas heaters at the cottage was not suitably qualified to undertake these particular checks, we would have taken alternative action.
