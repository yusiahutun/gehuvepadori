Son of Anna Marie Winkler and Harry Irving Winkler, Henry is an American by nationality.</p><p style=text-align:justify>His parents, meanwhile,&nbsp;had emigrated from Germany in 1939 on the eve of World War II. Henry was named after his uncle, who did not make it out from Germany.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Another New Yorker:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Gay Supporter Malcolm Gladwell Has Wife Amid Girl Problem?

He earned a bachelor's degree in 1967. And, then in 1970, went on to the Yale School of Drama to receive a Master of Fine Arts (MFA).</p><p style=text-align:justify>Even at the age of 73, Henry has managed to keep himself healthy. Nonetheless, he doesn't stray away from the dinner table, which is apparent from his weight. His height&nbsp;of 5 feet 6 inches&nbsp;(1.68 m) has further complimented his body stature. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h2 style=text-align:justify>Married: Wife & Kids</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Like his&nbsp;successful career, Henry also leads&nbsp;a prosperous family life.
