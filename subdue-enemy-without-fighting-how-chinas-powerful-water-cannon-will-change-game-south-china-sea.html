Since then, the technology has remained more or less the same due to its limited range of applications.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China has been vigorously developing its maritime forces in recent decades, including electromagnetic catapult aircraft carriers, hypersonic anti-ship missiles, ultra-high-power electronic warfare systems and other cutting-edge equipment.</p>They are formidable weapons, aimed squarely at the US military, but they are too much for <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">territorial disputes</span></a> against smaller Southeast Asian nations in the South China Sea.The vast disparity in military strength renders China’s hi-tech arsenal impractical against these neighbours. For instance, the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Philippines’</span></a> entire naval force owns only two frigates capable of launching missiles.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Recognising this imbalance, the Chinese government has ramped up investment in water cannon technology, developing a range of increasingly automated and powerful products.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The technology has also been aided from an unlikely quarter – China’s infrastructure projects. With large-scale land reclamation and other infrastructure projects under way, China has some of the world’s most powerful dredging vessels that suck seabed sediment to redistribute it to designated areas. The water pump technology involved in that process is perfectly suited to driving high-performance water cannons.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2022, China officially listed a water cannon with a range exceeding 100 metres in its export control catalogue, strengthening its dominant position in the use of the weapon.</p>So far, in South China Sea disputes, only China has used water cannons; the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Philippines</span></a> has not used any in retaliation. <img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2024/02/27/clear.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:49</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Chinese floating barrier blocks entrance to Philippine ships at South China Sea flashpoint</p><p>Chinese floating barrier blocks entrance to Philippine ships at South China Sea flashpoint</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhang Yuqiang, a researcher with the People’s Armed Police Maritime Police Academy Command Department, said that shipboard non-lethal weapons including water cannons “will play an increasingly important role in future maritime conflicts”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In recent years, competition and struggles around marine interests and power have become increasingly fierce, and maritime disputes have become a common challenge faced by most maritime countries in the world,” Zhang and his colleagues wrote in a paper published in the journal China Equipment Engineering in February.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Because all sides are “fighting for every inch of land and refusing to cede an inch”, the team said, using traditional lethal weapons in small-scale skirmishes could cause them escalate into large-scale armed conflicts. It is a situation that neither China nor other countries around the South China Sea wish to see.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Non-lethal weapons do not directly cause human death, equipment destruction and ecological damage. They only use specific technical means to deprive the other party’s personnel or equipment of their combat effectiveness, achieving the goal of ‘subduing the enemy without fighting’,” Zhang’s team wrote.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other major maritime countries are now stepping up research and deployment of other types of non-lethal weapons, including blinding lasers and microwaves that can cause skin-burning sensations, they said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There is also a particularly strong interest in infrasound weapons that “can cause dizziness, nausea, dyspnea and even neurological disorders”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Infrasound weapons have the characteristics of strong penetration, fast propagation speed, good concealment and long-range. In addition to attacking ships on the ocean surface, they also pose a significant threat to submarines in deep seas and will play an essential role in future naval battles,” they added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelny0r8iepZydX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2JqhXiDkWiqrpqUqrJusc2epLJlp57BqbvUrWSfoZedwaq6xmafqK9dmLWqusCsZKmnp5q%2Fp8HLZq6arJWneqStzaemp2WnnrmtecKhmKeflWK0ornEZqqoraSdeqS0yKeYZquVlg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bad-boys-4-casting-shakeup-tasha-smith-replace-theresa-randle-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bad Boys 4 casting shakeup!
