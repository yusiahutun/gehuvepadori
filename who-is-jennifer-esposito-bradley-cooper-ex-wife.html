"I literally laughed at him [Spade] because he was so bold in what he was saying," Esposito said in an Instagram video. She added that she "thought it was funny. I’m allowed to think something’s funny."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The actress explained that she did not watch the Oscars and that her message was not targeted at Cooper, his girlfriend Irina Shayk, nor Lady Gaga. “I feel bad for those people who are involved on the other side of the ‘Ha’ because it wasn’t at them.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While Gaga and Cooper's artistic chemistry is clear, the two are strictly friends.
