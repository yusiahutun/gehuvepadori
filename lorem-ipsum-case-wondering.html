It often appears in graphic design materials such as WordPress themes and publishing mockups.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This text looks like nonsense, so why is it so common? Let's take a look at what lorem ipsum copy is used for, what lorem ipsum means in English, and how you can easily generate this text yourself.</p><h2 id=what-is-lorem-ipsum>What Is Lorem Ipsum?</h2><p>Lorem ipsum is a name for a common type of placeholder text. Also known as filler or dummy text, this is text copy that serves to fill a space without saying anything meaningful. It's essentially nonsense text that still gives an idea of what real words will look like in the final product.</p><p>In case you're not familiar with it, the most common form of lorem ipsum text is the following:</p><p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-is-lorem-ipsum-text-used>Why Is Lorem Ipsum Text Used?</h2><p>You might wonder why, say, a <a href=#>Microsoft Word template site</a> would choose to use lorem ipsum text in its mockups, instead of a few paragraphs in English or the creator's native language. Why not just copy and paste a page from an old book or lyrics from a famous song?</p><p>The main reason for using lorem ipsum text is that it keeps people from focusing on the actual text. When someone creates a template and asks for feedback on it, they don't want the people reviewing it to get distracted by what the text says. Instead of focusing on the layout of the text, people might read the words to look for typos or sing along to the song lyrics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Additionally, lorem ipsum closely resembles text as it's normally laid out. Copying and pasting the same few words would result in an uneven distribution of letters. With lorem ipsum text, you can focus on how the font and page layout looks with copy that's almost fully realistic.</p><p>In that way, it's a bit like <a href=#>the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."</a> Windows uses this when previewing fonts, as it uses all the letters of the alphabet.</p><h2 id=where-did-lorem-ipsum-come-from>Where Did Lorem Ipsum Come From?</h2><p>While lorem ipsum text looks like gibberish, it's actually rooted in a real Latin text. It comes from Cicero's 45 BC work "De finibus bonorum et malorum" ("On the ends of good and evil" in English), which is a look at ethics. The lorem ipsum text comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33.</p><p>However, the common lorem ipsum text we use today is not proper Latin. Compared to Cicero's work, our lorem ipsum text is meaningless. It's had words added, removed, and changed that result in a mutation far from its initial form.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dr. Richard McClintock discovered the source of the text when searching for the rare Latin word "consectetur" ("enhanced" in English) in classical literature. His search turned up Cicero's work.</p><p>However, it's unknown who made these modifications to the text, or exactly when they did this, to turn it into the mess of words we know today. Sometime in the 1500s, an unknown printer scrambled words that survived into the digital age.</p><p>As far as its modern usage, the earliest known use of lorem ipsum text as a placeholder was in the 1960s, when a company called Letraset used this text on its typeface sheets. Later, in the 1980s, the now-defunct company Adlus also used lorem ipsum placeholder text in its PageMaker desktop publishing software.</p><h2 id=what-does-lorem-ipsum-mean-in-english>What Does Lorem Ipsum Mean in English?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Lorem-Ipsum-Billboard-Large.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As we've reviewed, lorem ipsum text doesn't really translate into anything sensible in English. Because the standard lorem ipsum text is a chopped-up version of an actual Latin text, you can't truly translate it.</p><p>The actual Latin sentence that the start of lorem ipsum text comes from reads as follows:</p><p>"Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit..."</p><p>In English, this translates to:</p><p>"There is no one who loves pain itself, who seeks after it and wants to have it, simply because it is pain..."</p><p>If you're interested in reading an English translation of the entire lorem ipsum passage, have a look at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lipsum.com</a>.

As you'd imagine, no site dedicated to this topic would be complete without its own lorem ipsum generator.</p><p>Notably, this site explains that it doesn't inject anything into its generated lorem ipsum text. It claims that other sites add humorous elements, start to repeat after some time, or use nonsensical text. This site instead uses proper Latin words.</p><p>Simply choose a number of paragraphs, words, bytes, or lists and click <strong>Generate Lorem Ipsum</strong> to get a chunk of text you can copy.

Check out this page, which links to all sorts of fun lorem ipsum text generators. Most of them don't actually use "lorem ipsum" in the text, but instead generate random text based on a theme.</p><p>Give "Coffee ipsum," "Cheeseburger ipsum," or "Zombie ipsum" a try here. Just keep in mind that the text from one of these might distract the people reviewing your layout, defeating the point of lorem ipsum text.
