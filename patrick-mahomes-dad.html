Like his son, Pat was also a professional athlete. He played as a professional pitcher in Major League Baseball from 1992 to 2003.</p><p>In his almost 10 years as a professional baseball player, Pat played for the Minnesota Twins, the Boston Red Sox, the New York Mets, the Texas Rangers, the Chicago Cubs and the Pittsburgh Pirates. Along with his Major League Baseball career, Pat also pitched two seasons in Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball in 1997 and 1998 for the Yokohama Bay Stars. Due to his baseball legacy, Pat is a member of the Sioux Falls Canaries Hall of Fame.</p><p>In an interview with CBS Sports in 2020, Patrick opened up about a conversation he had with his father after he signed a <a href=# rel=noopener>$500 million contract</a> with the Chiefs. “My dad texted me a couple days after the contract: ‘Do you feel any different,'” he recalled. “I said I feel exactly the same. I’m going to be the same person I was before I got the contract and before I got to the NFL—to be the best Patrick Mahomes I can be every single day.”</p><p>At a press conference in 2021, <a href=# rel=noopener>Patrick</a> also about the lessons he learned about parenthood from his own father and his sports career. “I got to see him battle and grind to try to get back there,” he said. “You never know if it’s going to be like this for the rest of your career. So I try to win as much as possible now and do whatever I can to win multiple Super Bowls.” He continued, “I’m at the right point in my career where I can use my voice and people can really, really make an impact in this world. This year, with everything that happened, it prompted me to really be bigger, and then be more than I had been before.”</p><p>In 2022, Patrick and his wife, Brittany Matthews welcomed their second child, a son named Patrick Lavone Mahomes III, after him and his father. (They welcomed their first child, a daughter named Sterling, in 2021.)</p><p>At a press conference in December 2022, Patrick explained why he wanted to name his son after him and his father, and how his brother, Jackson Mahomes, came up with his son’s nickname, Bronze.<span>“When me and Brittany, when we had Sterling, we didn’t know if it was a girl or boy at first. So we started thinking of girl and boy names. We wanted them to have that connection and them to be brother and sister forever,” he said.</span></p><p><span>“I’ve always wanted to do Patrick Lavon Mahomes III. I’ve thought about that since I was literally like five or six years old. I always thought it was going to be ‘Trey’ as the third — you hear of a lot of people doing that. My brother Jackson, whenever we were trying to find something that was a little unique and different, he said, “What about Bronze? It fits perfectly with Sterling.’ We went with that, and I think it works out well.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfpa61vsicomalkZ28rrHSZpuanF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./priscilla-presley-difficult-confession-raising-lisa-marie-presley-with-elvis.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Priscilla Presley's difficult confession about raising Lisa Marie Presley with Elvis Presley why</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./early-days-examples-of-view-transitions.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Early Days Examples of View Transitions Chris Coyier</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
