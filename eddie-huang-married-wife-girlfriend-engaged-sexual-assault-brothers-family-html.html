Some couples take their engagement into marital dimensions, while some relationships fail to reach that level. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>But what happened to the engaged relation between American chef, Eddie Huang and his girlfriend turned fiance? Did they get married after getting engaged or did they venture on separate paths?</p><p style=text-align:justify>Well, you no longer have to wonder!</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Married With Wife Or Still Engaged To Girlfriend?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Eddie Huang, age 37, has always maintained a low-key personal life, no wonder there are budding curiosities amidst his fans. But, one thing we all know is that Eddie once mentioned that he was engaged to his girlfriend named Dena, who grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania in an Italian-Irish-American family. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Suggested:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# title="Harry Shum Jr. Baby, Wife, Married" rel=follow>Harry Shum Jr. Baby, Wife, Married</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Huang made his relationship with Dena come to the recognition of readers and his fans through his memoir. In the journal, Eddie also expressed how it was like to get permission from her father to propose her.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Speaking of him asking for Mr. Fusco's (Dena's father) permission to propose Dena, he wrote what her father said as, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>“Eddie, it’s a Communist country and, look, you know I’m an open-minded g#uy, but come on, I don’t have to tell you how bad it can get. It’s not the same. It’s not America.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>But eventually, his efforts paid off and then Mr. Fusco decided to give them his blessing, and they got engaged. However, the engagement between them did not last, and thus, they called off their plans to get married 18 months later. Speaking about the breakup and the calling off of the commitment, Eddie shared,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>“I wanted to cross a bridge so I paid the toll, I paid the toll, I asked the father, I felt like a monkey.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Nothing got revealed by the man about the reason for the demise of their relationship, but it is now clear that the two did not take their relationship to marital dimensions and the connection was limited to engagement only.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>So, now that everyone is aware that he did not get married to the girl he was engaged to and failed to make her his wife; everyone might be willing to know as to how his romantic aspect looks like at present. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Explore New:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# title="Romeo Santos Baby, Girlfriend, Engaged" rel=follow>Romeo Santos Baby, Girlfriend, Engaged</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>In&nbsp;2013, Eddie&nbsp;posted some interesting pictures on his Instagram where he has called Lena Sanvito his "wifey."

Hence, without his official word of affirmation or falsification, no significant conclusion can be reached for now.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2 style=text-align:justify>Eddie Huang & The Sexual Assault He Kept Hidden For 20 Long Years</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Eddie Huang, like several teenagers and kids these days, was a victim of sexual harassment back when he was 14. Eddie suffered harassment during a&nbsp;Baptist church ski trip and kept it a secret for 20 long years until he chose to open up about it in a New York Magazine cut. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Eddie wrote,</p><p style=text-align:justify>“I just feel powerless to the memory. Him taking his time with the shower, steaming up the room, then coming out with his d— hanging out,”</p><p style=text-align:justify>“He took out a Bible and started to read scripture with his d— hard,”&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>“My chest started to tighten and I couldn’t breathe, fearful for what would happen next. The panic turned to outrage and ultimately humiliation.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>But despite having the thoughts of battling the person, their difference in height and size stopped him. He also chose not to call the cops or tell anyone about it, fearing no one would believe in his words.</p><p style=text-align:justify>“Even if I told somebody, there was nothing they could give back to make me whole again."</p><p style=text-align:justify>"Finally, after more than 15 minutes, he packed his d— and left.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Eddie mentioned that he had a friend with him on the trip who was the only one to know about the incident. Also, Eddie never thought about speaking about the event because he didn't want it to define him.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Accused Of Sexual Assault:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Mario Batali Won't Be Charged For Sexual Assault, Find Out Why" rel=follow>Mario Batali Won't Be Charged For Sexual Assault, Find Out Why</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>However, <a href=# rel=follow>Harvey Weinstein's</a> case happened later when Eddie was in China with his family, girlfriend, and brothers.

After college, he also tried his hands in stand-up comedy.</p><p style=text-align:justify>And in 2009, he opened BoaHaus, a Taiwanese restaurant in East Village New York.
