She was leaving the office and grabbed alcohol&nbsp;to share with friends she was hosting at the Bryans'&nbsp;house that evening.</p><p>"I put it in the backseat … forget about it all day," she recalls.</p><p>Three o’clock rolls around, and it’s Caroline's turn to pick up not just her&nbsp;two sons, but the neighborhood children, too.</p><p>"Kids start hoping in the car and I’m in the middle of the pickup line,”&nbsp;Bryan explains. “I’m around parents, teachers, students, everybody."</p><p>There was no hiding it — before&nbsp;Caroline knew it, the bottle of Tito's had&nbsp;slipped out of the car as the doors were being opened, crashing to the ground, right in front of a teacher.</p><p>Flustered, Caroline&nbsp;says she couldn't find words as the teacher came to aid her in cleaning up the broken glass. "I wasn’t thinking and I went … it’s liquor!" she&nbsp;exclaims.</p><p>"There’s no telling what these people think of me. I’m mortified."</p><p>All in all, Caroline took it like a champ, hoping other&nbsp;parents could&nbsp;find the fiasco relatable.</p><p>“I don’t always embarrass myself, but when I do, Tito's is typically involved," she admits in the caption of her video, asking fans to tell her their embarrassing stories to make her feel better.</p><p>Clearly, her "mom fail" moment&nbsp;found the right crowd: After hearing her story, fans took to the comments section of her video, sharing similar laughable failures as a parent.</p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Buy Luke Bryan Concert Tickets Here</a><p>Caroline is always quick to show the “messy” of being a mom, especially a "boy mom." Before her vodka&nbsp;debacle, she gave fans a little peek at what life with boys looks like. With a series of videos, she showed that&nbsp;life absolutely isn’t boring over there at the&nbsp;Bryan household.</p><p>“I’ve seen a lot of people doing the 'Boy moms add your boys'" she says of a recent social media trend. "Well … here’s a little view of mine."</p><p>"And yes … I include Luke as a child. Most days."</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Pictures: See Inside Luke Bryan's Stunning Beach House</h2><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke Bryan</a> listed his 4,600-square-foot beach house for sale in December 2022.
