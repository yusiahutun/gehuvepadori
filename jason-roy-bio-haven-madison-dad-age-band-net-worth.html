In the Las Vegas audition (which aired on February 19), Haven wowed all three judges–Katy Perry, Luke Bryan, and Lionel Richie–with her jaw-dropping original “Fifteen.”</p><p>Ahead of her audition, Haven revealed that she virtually grew up on a tour bus because her father, Jason Roy, fronted the Christian rock band Building 429.</p><p>Jason accompanied his daughter on acoustic guitar during the audition. As Haven completed her performance, the “Teenage Dreams” singer leaped from her seat and said, “You can have it!.” Lionel followed suit and said, “You can have it right now. In fact, let’s go to the studio right now,” praising Haven’s songwriting abilities. “I think when a 16-year-old can really speak the 16-year-old language that all the other 16-year-olds want to hear, it’s really special,” Luke jumped in on the conversation.</p><p>With three yeses, Haven moved on to the next round. In the Hollywood Round, Haven was one of the three contestants competing for a fourth Platinum Ticket alongside Elijah McCormick and Matt Wilson. Although Haven did not get one following a vote at the American Music Award, she chose to work on her songwriting in the first part of Hollywood Week.</p><p>Clarksville resident sang an original song “Still Need You,” inspired by her brother Avery’s struggle with mental health and depression. For her final solo performance, Haven sang “Bird Set Free” by Sia, which took her to the Top 26 Finalist. For her Top 26 performance, Haven sang “The Middle” by Zedd, Maren Morris & Grey.</p><p>One of the main elements in Haven’s success as a singer/writer is her father, Jason Roy, without question.</p><p>On September 26, 2022, Jason shared on his Instagram how much he believes in his daughter. He wrote, “I believe in you when you win. I believe in you when you lose. I’ve believed in you since you took your first breath. Since the moment of your first cry… Keep changing the world for the better one person at a time. I’ll be cheering as you go!,” on the occasion of National Daughters Day.</p><h3><strong>Jason Roy Band</strong></h3><p>Haven’s father, Jason Roy, fronts the Christian rock band Building 429.
