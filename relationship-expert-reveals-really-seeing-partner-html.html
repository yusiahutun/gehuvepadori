the crazy hormones,' she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Taking things slow in the early days prolongs the honey moon period/ that period of high desire, excitement and attraction – which is a huge bonus and allows you to establish a more solid connection.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'As the old saying goes, "absence makes the heart grow fonder", which is absolutely true.</p><p

Rushing things too early on ruins many good relationships</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This is especially in relation to rushing into sex too early as doing so can make you to feel intense emotions.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It can cause you to feel vulnerable, possibly needy and insecure about your decisions because you haven’t had time to build trust in that person,' she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox">2. You are able to see who they really are</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'By getting to know a person slowly you decide if they are for you. It builds trust, reducing vulnerability and boosts your confidence,' Samantha said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The less anxious you feel the more likely the relationship will last and the more confident you are the sexier they will find you as confidence is considered to be very attractive.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox">3. You don’t lose yourself</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When you take the time to get into a relationship it allows you to stay true to who you are.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox">4. Quality vs quantity</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By not seeing each other every day the moments you see each other will be of quality.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'If you see each other every day you may spend a lot of time just doing a whole a lot of nothing, mundane tasks killing time instead of being present,' she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Presence is the greatest gift you can give someone. Being adventurous is a great way to be present.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox">5. Keep your connections with friends and family</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In this day and age it’s impossible to fit everyone into your life. Seeing each other once week you can make the transition nice and smooth.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox">6. Saves your relationship from burnout</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'If you see each other once a week you can prevent over doing it. It's like eating too much cake, after a while it doesn’t taste as good anymore. When you enjoy it every now and then it’s so much sweeter!'
