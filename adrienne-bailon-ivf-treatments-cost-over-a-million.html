"So it was a pretty tough six years of trying to have my son."</p><p>When asked how much she believes her years of fertility treatments cost her, she said, "easily over a million."</p><p>"And that is not realistic for the average person," she added. "And I recognize that."</p><p>The Real alum previously spoke out about how she struggled to get pregnant.</p><p>"I think so many people are very insensitive to that, in the sense [that] I know you guys are like, 'Is she pregnant?' 'Her face is fuller' -- FYI I've always had a really chubby face so that's not what it is," Bailon-Houghton said on an episode of The Real back in 2018, per PEOPLE.</p><p>"I think that as an audience we should be sensitive to the fact that everybody doesn't get pregnant right away," she added. "I think for myself I thought it would happen so easily for me and it just hasn't happened that way."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Bailon-Houghton said at the time that she was "at peace" knowing "it'll happen when it's God's timing and I believe in that and I have faith in all of that."</p><p>"But it can be really discouraging and it can be really frustrating," she explained.</p><p>In August 2022, the talk show host and her husband revealed the exciting news that they had welcomed their first child via surrogate. Bailon-Houghton announced the news on Instagram at the time, while also touching upon her fertility struggles.</p><p>"Our baby boy is here & we are so in love! If you have followed our love story‚Ä¶ you know that our journey to baby has been very challenging - But God is true to His word and His promises," she wrote. "We have quietly prayed while sitting on this most magnificent secret for the last 9 months."</p><p>"He is worth every tear, every disappointment, every delayed prayer, every IVF cycle, every miscarriage," she added. "Everything. All we feel is joy and overwhelming love & gratitude. Grateful to God, to our angel surrogate and to all of our friends and family who have stood with us for over 5 years on this journey. He‚Äôs here and we have never been happier to lose sleep! #HappilyEverHoughton ü§ç"</p><a id=gallery-link-8337fb39-bb2e-4598-ae89-5f71cefa638a class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:8337fb39-bb2e-4598-ae89-5f71cefa638a data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:18373af3-b9d5-4631-8de0-fe16a68eb77e data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/30/4by3/2024/01/04/301e949192f94e9e98edd78025abbb73_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21ma2tflrGztcSnpZ5lkpa2rbvNZqCvnl2pv6at06acp6yjYrCwv9Nmpq%2BdomKubrnIpaOip55k</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cat-person-movie-clip-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cousin Greg?
