Her father held her hand when she was just starting. <a id=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Heatherton#Early_career href=# title="Joey Heatherton" rel="nofollow noopener">She first appeared</a> in her father's popular children's show known as the ‘ Merry Mailman.'</p><p class=align-left>When she was 15 years, she gained her first national exposure when she became a semi-regular in The Peri Como Show which was later changed to Perry Como's Kraft Music hall.</p><p class=align-left>That same year, Heatherton released her first single dubbed ‘That's How It Goes' or ‘I'll Be Seeing You'. She later released other three singles, but they did not make a hit. Her first television role was as a spoiled rich teen in an episode in Route 66.</p><p class=align-left>In April 1969, Joey married Lance Rentzel who was in November 1970 charged with indecent exposure to a 10-year-old, and he later pleaded guilty. Rentzel promised to go through psychiatric treatment and was suspended. This must have been a disappointment to Heatherton and more so a heartbreak. She filed for a divorce in September of 1971. The divorce was finalized in 1972. At this point her career lost its spark, some say that she never recovered from learning about his ex husband's behaviour.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1a977798eeaa6e5b.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rebecca King-Crews: Family, nationality, ethnicity, cancer, siblings</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=# title="Joey Heatherton bio" rel="nofollow noopener">Joey was arrested twice </a>in the year 1985.
