Areas commonly affected by the disease include the ribs, spine, pelvis, skull, collarbone (clavicle) and jaw.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When the disease affects the maxillofacial area, pain, loose teeth, fractures and facial deformity may develop.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The exact cause of Gorham's is unknown. No environmental, immunological or genetic risk factors have been identified.
