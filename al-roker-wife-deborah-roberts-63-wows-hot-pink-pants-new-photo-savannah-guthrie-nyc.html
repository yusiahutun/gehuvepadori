HELLO! were also in attendance, and chatted to Savannah at her event, who admitted that the book's success so early on in its shelf life is a huge blessing, especially as it was such a "vulnerable" thing to work on.&nbsp;</p><p id=ePw_9MGIY2 data-wc=39>"I mean, it touches my heart especially because this is such a personal and vulnerable thing to do. So the fact that people are responding so kindly is just, it's touching and also a relief and really moves me."&nbsp;</p><p id=ee5HL4zD40 data-wc=60>The book had been likened by both Savannah and her co-star Hoda - also at the event - to a "warm bug". "What makes me the happiest is that I've had people now from all walks of life, all different faiths, no faith at all say they've read it and found something in it that resonates with them," she said.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7e72faf073b3-stephanie-ruhle-today-team.jpg><p id=eXe9cbmYwF data-wc=29>"And I do think that these are really universally appealing themes and I'm just hopeful that it feels like a warm hug because that's what I hope to do."&nbsp;</p><p id=eKcTBwSqlW data-wc=64>Savannah also told HELLO! that her book - which is dedicated to her two children - is a lot about what she has learnt when things aren't quite so perfect in her life. "I knew I was writing something that I wanted my kids to know, mostly what I had learned over all these years, not from living a perfect life, but the opposite.&nbsp;</p><p id=ej_KZLRWqt data-wc=50>"Not because things always went well for me. Because that's when you learn about faith and where you know it really comes to rescue you. So I'm hoping that no matter what, they'll have something and they'll understand what I've learned in life about the God that really loves them."</p><p id=e4w0IvCx3H data-wc=6>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
