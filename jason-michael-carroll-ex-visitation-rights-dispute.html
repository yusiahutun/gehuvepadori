In the texts, he appears to be asking her for her bank account information so he can make a direct transfer of money to her, and also reminds her that they are supposed to meet at a certain place to exchange their kids for his visitation per a court order. The exchange ends with her finally saying, "Mail me the check & don't text me anymore," with him repeatedly explaining that he is trying to get money to her.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter"><p><span class=visually-hidden>Instagram</span></p>Instagram<p>loading...</p></figure><p>"This is me trying to communicate and get my ex wife's bank account info so I can deposit my child support," he writes. "If it's this difficult to 'pay' her, imagine how difficult it is to actually get my time with my kids! We have never been 'great' together but I had hoped that eventually she wouldn't use the kids the way she has."</p><p>He adds that they can't even speak on the phone because their relationship is so bad, saying, "Her game is getting back at me."</p><p>Carroll also claims that his ex will let him arrange visits with his children by texting them, but then grounds them from their phones if they communicate too much with him.</p><p>"Reluctantly I have tried to organize meeting my kids, with them directly. NO KIDS SHOULD EVER BE PUT IN THAT SITUATION," he writes, also claiming that he had to wait two-and-a-half hours to try to pick up his kids, only to be told their uncle was going to bring them to his house, When he drove the half hour back home, Carroll says his daughter then texted to say the uncle was no longer going to bring them.</p><p>"I know that ALL Fathers may not be very involved with their kids, but I have always tried to be, constantly getting refused and neglected by my ex and the 'Good Ole Boy' Granville County Court System," Carroll states. "I know there are other Fathers out there getting their time stolen by a vindictive ex and there needs to be some group or something to help make sure this doesn't happen to them. It's too late for me. I'm just hoping I can bring attention to this horrible situation and help others going through it. I'm tired."</p><p><strong>Country Music's Most Doting Dads</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo5mjpLtuucicn5qdnGKwor7RqKOlZZWtere10qKrmqyZpLtuvsign62rXZm2tLzUrZxo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rihanna-alexis-mabille-jumpsuit-diamond-ball.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rihanna Wears Sheer Lace Jumpsuit with Bow To 4th Annual Diamond Ball</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hailey-bieber-justin-engagement-ring-blake-lively-photo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hailey Bieber's $500k engagement ring was inspired by Blake Lively</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
