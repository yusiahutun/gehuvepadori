She tilts her face, which is covered with a sheet mask, toward the hot California sun. Her tousled gray hair up is in that signature bun at the top of her head. “How do I look?” she asks me, laughing, as she is prepped for her portrait for this story. “I’m old, my skin is falling down, and it’s not going to change, but I don’t give a shit.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Marant is in Los Angeles to celebrate her namesake brand’s 30th anniversary. Often credited as one of the progenitors of what has become known as “French-girl style”—an exhausted catchall phrase deployed to encompass anything that appears effortless and artfully disheveled—she is quick to point out that “being cool is about not paying too much attention to ourselves, but, in reality, French girls spend a lot of time to look unpolished.” Her clothes, she says, “aren’t actually particularly that French.”</p><img alt="isabel marant" title="How Isabel Marant Transcended French-Girl Style" width=2250 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/0142-harpers-us-isabel-marant-shot-01-309-jpeg-final-wm-6619780b73504.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Lorenz Schmidl</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Born and raised in the Paris suburbs, Marant launched her label in 1994, but she really started in 1989 with a small accessories line of belts and jewelry. In 1990, she started a knitwear label called Twen with her mother, Christa Fielder, a former model who also ran the Elite modeling agency for a time. Marant’s goal has always been to design clothes that she herself would wear, to create unfussy, approachable wardrobe staples that are equal parts cool, sexy, and comfortable. Throughout the late ’90s and especially in the 2000s and 2010s, Marant’s brand—which also includes men’s and secondary lines—came to define a nonchalant attitude of dress, typified by vintage-inspired micro-floral-print ruffled minidresses and skirts, cotton blouses with fringed jackets, and slouchy boots with a tiny heel and pointed toe.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“I don’t have a HUGE PRETENSION about FASHION.”<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The “boho chic” style that dominated the 2000s—picture Sienna Miller, Nicole Richie, or Kate Moss in printed skinny pants and a butterfly-sleeve blouse or oversize blazer—owes much to Isabel Marant. She was also one of the pioneers of fashion’s move toward athleisure when she dropped her hugely influential wedge sneaker in the early 2010s (which has made a comeback of late). Marant ultimately did the most powerful thing a designer can do in fashion: She created a look. That look, notes Ssense head of content Steff Yotka, is at the root of so many viral trends and memes that we see today, including “Christian girl autumn,” “cottagecore,” and “coastal cowgirl.” While all those phrases conjure up similar sartorial codes—the skinny jeans, the boots, the dainty florals, flounce, and fringe—the Marant aesthetic is the OG, the North Star. And it still has mass appeal. One of my best friends, who lives in Chicago, has three kids, and works in PR, not anywhere near fashion, put it like this over text: “You absolutely know the clothes are hers without seeing a label.”</p><img alt="celebrities wearing isabel marant" title="celebrities wearing isabel marant" width=2500 height=3126 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/isabel-marant-celebrity-collage-v2-661d98a000e96.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Clockwise from top: Sienna Miller, Alek Wek, Caroline de Maigret, Kate Bosworth, Chriselle Lim, Ashley Graham</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As Marant explains, “My brand was never a young-kid wardrobe. I’m also often asked if I do specific things for women in America versus Asia versus Europe, and I’ve just never thought that way. I’ve always looked at the silhouettes worn by contemporary women who raise kids and go to the office and want to look good but not too overdressed. And I have a very trusting clientele still. I don’t think the customer has changed over the years. I have the mother, the daughter, and the grandmother.” She adds: “It’s really this balance of giving pleasure and confidence to the people who wear your clothes. You just want to feel comfortable and not too shitty. That’s the goal.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">Isabel Marant, Past and Present</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="a model on the runway at the isabel marant fall 2009 show at couvent des cordeliers in paris photo by fairchild archivepenske media via getty images" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1458645325-661d883b879e5.jpg title="Isabel Marant Fall 2009 RTW, Paris" width=2832 height=4256 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That approach, however naturally it may have come to Marant, has proven hugely successful—especially over the last couple of years, when the fashion industry, particularly in the luxury space, has found itself in a financial and existential limbo. In 2022, according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/luxury/isabel-marants-plan-to-scale-parisienne-luxury-into-a-500m-business/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Business of Fashion" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Business of Fashion</a>, the brand made $323 million in sales, and it is projected to reach $500 million in the next four to five years. Where many brands have chased internet trends, Marant has steadfastly held tight to her point of view. She has capitalized on a vibe and created aspirational clothes that make women want to buy into cool, rather than a status-raising price tag or logo. In a way, as much as she would never admit it, she was one of the original influencers in the fashion space, using her intuition and effortless style to attract hardcore fans. “You have to focus on what people are really wearing,” Marant says. “Otherwise, there’s not really a point, and it might be very difficult to succeed.…Either you do art or you’re in the ready-to-wear business. I always took that term [ready-to-wear] literally; I don’t have a huge pretension about fashion.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“You just want to FEEL COMFORTABLE and NOT TOO SHITTY. That’s the GOAL.”<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Marant concedes she does have moments when the demands of running a big business can be dispiriting. “It’s all still very organic and crafty, the way we process the creation of our collections,” she says. “I still enjoy doing that, but it’s true that we have a lot of demands: a capsule for this or another accessory for this. It’s never-ending. So I do feel a bit frustrated about having the feeling that I don’t have time to achieve things properly because we are always lacking time. It’s a bit disgusting, I must say, this machine that you have to feed all the time.” Marant is so deeply in love with what she does, though, and she is also quick to note that this kind of tension between ambition and wanting to pull back is specific to women. “Women do so much more than men, they don’t even realize,” she says. “I really admire a woman specifically who is very discreet but very efficient at the same time.”</p><img alt="isabel marant" title="isabel marant" width=2500 height=1667 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/0142-harpers-us-isabel-marant-shot-01-285-jpeg-final-wm-6619780b96836.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Lorenz Schmidl</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">A new version of Marant’s wedge sneaker is selling out, and, thanks in large part to her stellar Fall 2024 runway show in Paris, there is renewed excitement around the brand. That collection, the designer notes, is a return to her roots, with updated versions of her classics, including slouchy leather trousers that sit low and are belted at the hip, western-style jackets and vests, oversize outerwear, pretty florals, and hints of animal prints. The collection was styled by French fashion editor and stylist Emmanuelle Alt, a woman who has also left an indelible mark on the fashion industry with, yes, a Parisian-specific style formula that has been emulated by the masses. Think black skinny jeans plus boots plus worn-in T-shirt and leather jacket.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Every cool girl in New York is wearing the Isabel Marant wedge sneaker right now, including several in our office,” says Yotka. Nordstrom fashion director Rickie De Sole explains that Marant’s continued appeal and longevity have to do with the fact that “commercially, you really have a full wardrobe to work with. That’s the way people shop today. Plus, what’s great with her collections is that you can take something from 10 years ago and mix it with something today. There’s always consistency.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“BEING COOL is about NOT PAYING too much ATTENTION to OURSELVES.”<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">Earlier, Marant and I had lingered over an an easy, enjoyable lunch. We spoke about our families and her teenage son, who welds jewelry in their home in Paris, and her walks at their country home, which used to have no power or running water and which she retreats to every single weekend, shutting herself away from work completely. We also chatted about her love of craft and her passion for ceramics. She was recounting her recent finds from the flea market in Santa Monica when Kanye West walked by our table. “ISABEL MARANT!” he exclaimed at a giddy pitch.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Moments later, he returned, walking past our table again, but this time toward the building’s not-so-secret secret exit and this time with his wife, Bianca Censori, who wore what looked like a silk duvet cover. West and Censori smiled and said hello, and we nodded back. Marant, again, was unfazed. I mentioned to her that I remembered West referencing her work, in particular the wedge sneaker, when he first started his fashion brand Yeezy. She grinned and shrugged, popping a french fry into her mouth. West’s starstruck reaction says something about the long-term impact Marant has had on fashion and pop culture. In that moment, I’m also reminded of the Coi Leray song <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjLtG2TS6ms" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“Isabel Marant,”" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">“Isabel Marant,”</a> which came out last summer. Going further back, when Marant launched a collaboration with H&M in 2013, it sold out in minutes and made the website crash. Her influence runs deeper than most probably realize.</p><img alt="isabel marant" title="isabel marant" width=1667 height=2084 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/0142-harpers-us-isabel-marant-shot-01-246-jpeg-final-wm-6619780adac09.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Lorenz Schmidl</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Back on the balcony, I ask Marant if she is on social media beyond the brand-led Instagram and TikTok. She has a finsta account, she says, but really uses it only to watch instructional videos on ceramic art. Even the Isabel Marant brand accounts feel somewhat reserved. If you scroll through, you won’t find a lot of hashtags, GRWM content from ambassadors, or gimmicky campaigns featuring Marant front and center. It’s all pretty straightforward: beautiful fashion imagery spliced in with some runway videos and a couple of fun “what’s in my bag” shorts. “It’s not my generation, and I’m very bad with those skills,” Marant says. “It’s not really me, but I know I have to do it. And when I was coming up in fashion, it was an era where designers were much more discreet. If I could have been like Martin Margiela and not ever show my face, I would have. It’s always been about the clothes, not ourselves.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Marant hosts the anniversary dinner party poolside at the Chateau later that evening. It is also two days before her birthday. She wears a sheer, tight Lurex top with no bra, a silver embellished jacket, and studded shorts. Her enchanting, toothy smile is on full display as she sips a margarita and chats with her guests, including model Ashley Graham, actor Kate Bosworth, and DJ Honey Dijon. Alt and Kim Bekker, artistic director at Isabel Marant, are there too.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At the end of the evening, I go over to Marant to say goodbye. I thank her for spending time with me, and she thanks me back. Without saying anything else, she hugs me tightly, looks me square in the eye, and smiles that uncanny smile again, holding my arms. I realizes then that she has the effect of a kind of guru; she doesn’t have to say much to make you feel like you never want to leave her orbit.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">Photographs: Lorenz Schmidl; makeup: Lisa Storey.</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfm660tMiopWiclai2qLrEq6pomWZlgXl%2Bl25waKGjlq%2BmuIymmKuZnql6p77Ep5qhZZeev6150q2wpZ1f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./503675-list-narok-postal-codes-area-codes-zip-code.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>List of Narok postal codes, area codes, and the ZIP code</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-do-this-when-andrew-scott-asked-director-steve-zaillian-before-signing-up-for-mini-series-ripley-1295487.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why do this?
