With less friction, you are assured of fuel economy and durability.</li><li>No more bumps and scrapes – These are the major causes of early damage and punctures. So as you park, try as much as possible not to mount the kerbs.</li><li>Drive carefully – Avoid aggressive acceleration, sharp brakes, and speeding corners. Not only are these risky behaviours, but they also make the tyres wear faster.</li><li>Free your car – How many things have you kept in your boot? Do you need all those? Making your car lighter significantly reduces tyre wear. So, remove all that unnecessary baggage and let your wheels last.</li><li>Align your wheels – Driving at the wrong wheel angle could lead to uneven, rapid wear. To increase their longevity, ensure the alignment is as specified by the manufacturer.</li><li>Maintain the specified pressure – Under-inflating the tyres could affect fuel economy and handling, wear down tread, and cause blowouts. You can avoid all these by maintaining the manufacturer’s specifications.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4f1a15ae6b95e0d9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nairobi to Malindi bus services, booking, and fares in 2022</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Now you have a clear idea of the best tyres in Kenya.
