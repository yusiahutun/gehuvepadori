The entire ordeal left a mark on him and even changed how he approached his songs afterward.</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>music</a> legend now believes that his lyrics in his songs had a part to play in his life. Before the murder case threatened to change Snoop Dogg’s life forever, he would rap about his own experiences. Seeing death, people killed, crime and losing those around him would be a focal point in his songs. Or, as Snoop would say it, “life as a G”. But it turns out the murder charges attorneys tried to pin on him, 30 years ago, changed Snoop Dogg forever.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-51975051-1024x686.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-snoop-dogg-s-three-years-in-hell-after-murder-charges>Snoop Dogg’s three years in hell after murder charges</h2><p>Snoop was one of America’s up-and-coming rap artists at the time the crime took place. In August 1993, gang member Philip Woldemariam died at a park. District attorneys charged the <a href=#>celebrity</a> with first and second degree murder charges. His bodyguard McKinley Lee was also charged with conspiracy to commit assault in connection to the case.</p><p>Prosecutors claimed Woldermariam died in cold-blooded murder, alleging he was shot in the back and buttocks by Snoop. They told the court he attempted to flee after getting into an argument with rival Snoop and his bodyguard at Woodbine Park.</p><p>However, the defense argued the gang member reached for a weapon he was carrying when Lee fired in self-defense from a car he was in with Snoop. Under testimony, it was heard that a weapon from Woldermariam was removed.</p><p>Jurors acquitted the star, who was only 24 years old at the time, as well as his bodyguard. But the jury of his peers couldn’t come to a decision on a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter against each of the men, as well as a charge of conspiracy after the fact against Snoop.</p><p>The judge sent them back to the jury room to deliberate further. They had already spent six days talking it over. When they finally came back in, the not-guilty verdicts were being read out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-snoop-s-life-was-in-limbo-for-almost-three-years>Snoop’s life was in limbo for almost ‘three years’</h2><p>The Los Angeles Times <a href=# rel=nofollow>reports</a> supporters of Snoop – real name Calvin Broadus – and Lee erupted in the courtroom.</p><p>Snoop, head down, held his hands in prayer as his bodyguard signed in relief. The moment was broadcast on <a href=#>TV</a>.</p><p>He left the court smiling while holding onto his two-year-old son, Corde. Snoop drove away to return to his life in a Rolls-Royce.</p><p>“They made the right decision, you know what I’m saying?” said Snoop.</p><p>“This has been an ordeal that has affected our lives for the past 2 1/2 years. I was just trying to figure out if I was going to be here to raise my son.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-changed-how-he-wrote-about-death-even-if-it-cost-him-success>He changed how he wrote about death – even if it cost him success</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-106023042-1024x693.jpg><p>The case had a long-lasting effect on Snoop, who spoke with Fatman Scoop on an <a href=#>Instagram</a> Live in January 2021.</p><p>He pivoted how he rapped and the topics he talked about after believing his words had more power than just engaging fans.</p><p>He said: “Around that time, me, Tupac, Biggie, [Ice] Cube… all of the rappers that was rapping around that time; we was writing what we was living,” he said.</p><p>“Some of us was writing life and some of us was writing death, but that’s what we was living.”</p><p>“On my second album,&nbsp;Tha&nbsp;Doggfather, when I beat my murder case, I redirected my pen to write life because I felt like I had wrote death all up until that point.”</p><p>He no longer wanted to “glamorize and glorify” death, and instead wanted to focus on “living”. But it did cost him fans and success.</p><p>He admitted: “I lost a lot of fans; I lost a lot of homies because they wanted me to keep it gangsta after beating the murder case.”</p><p>Snoop said he felt “remorse”, and his life “changed” – “This was a real situation”.</p><p><strong>You can <a href=# rel=nofollow>watch</a> the inspiring clip here.</strong></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2d9cL%2FNqKapZZSktKh5y6KtnpxdnrtussSaqWaen6d6tbTRnpxmr5ikuaZ52J6Yq6tdlrO1sdFmmZ6hnpx6uL7AqaeenF2qvW61zWakrqqUmr9ur8CsnGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./juliet-casablancas.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Juliet Casablancas dating?
