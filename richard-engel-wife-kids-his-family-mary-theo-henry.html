The couple has another son, Theo. Get to know his family, here.</p><h2>Richard and Mary’s Eldest Son Henry Died After a Lifelong Battle With Rett Syndrome</h2><p>“Our beloved son Henry passed away. He had the softest blue eyes, an easy smile and a contagious giggle,” the couple announced via Twitter on August 18. He had suffered from developmental disorders all of his life and was diagnosed with Rett syndrome in 2017.</p><h2>Richard and Mary Cherished Every Moment With Henry</h2><p>When Henry was 3 years old, Richard penned an <a href=#>essay about how emotional he became</a> when his son said “Dada” for the first time.&nbsp;“His physical and mental development aren’t on pace with other children. So, when I got the Dada from him, I went a little wild,” the journalist wrote in the piece published on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Today</a>.</p><p>“To parents with typically developing children, a little Dada may not seem like a big deal. But for me it was a validation, an acknowledgement that he’s in there, knows me, knows that his mother and I are forces for good in his life, and above all, that he loves us,” he continued.</p><p>Richard acknowledged that his son was “probably not going to walk, probably not going to speak, probably not going to have any mental capacity beyond the level of a 2-year-old.”</p><h2>Richard and Wife Mary Have Been Married Since 2015</h2><p>The foreign correspondent wed TV producer Mary Forrest on May 29, 2015, in a civil ceremony at New York City Hall. The pair had met five years prior when Mary was working on <a href=#><strong>Martha Stewart</strong></a>‘s daytime talk show and Richard appeared as a guest.</p><p>At the time, the newsman tweeted his wedding announcement: “So happy. Just got married! To&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=@MaryKForrest data-scaytid=1>@MaryKForrest</span>. My longtime love and girlfriend.” Mary was already pregnant with Henry at the time, and the couple welcomed their first child on September 29, 2015.</p><h2>Richard and Mary Have a Second Son, Theo</h2><p>The couple welcomed their red-haired little boy in August 2019. The Monday following his weekend birth, Richard revealed the news on the Today Show, sharing a photo holding Theo in the hospital wrapped in a blanket with a blue knit beanie on his head.</p><p>“Mary and I are so excited to introduce our new son Theodore (Theo),” Richard told the show via email. “He’s healthy, happy (unless you unwrap his swaddle) and thirsty. We couldn’t be more in love. And now Henry is a big brother, too.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Life has twists, turns and new beginnings. This is Theo’s first chapter, and a new one for our family. We’re excited, nervous and thankful,” he added.</p><h2>Theo Loved His Big Brother Henry</h2><p>Richard shared a tender <a href=#>Twitter video</a> in May 2022 of Theo giving his bedridden brother sweet kisses after Henry took a turn for the worse.&nbsp; Following a six-week hospitalization, the reporter noted that his son was “now home and getting love from brother Theo.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46roJygkaexbrHNoJylZaees6Z5yqKbrGWYnsBussCmoKWxXaKus8WMrZ%2Bep12dsq%2B%2B2Gg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-best-memes-of-shirtless-jason-kelce-as-he-cheers-on-brother-travis.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Best Memes Of Shirtless Jason Kelce Cheering On Travis Alongside Taylor Swift</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./patti-labelles-ex-husband-armstead-edwards-what-is-he-doing-now.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Patti LaBelles Ex-Husband Armstead Edwards: What Is He Doing Now?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
