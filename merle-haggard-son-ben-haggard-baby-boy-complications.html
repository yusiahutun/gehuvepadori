Beyzade had to be rushed into surgery for an emergency C-section, where she experienced even more complications. She says she could feel the room start to fade away, and in that moment, she believed she was dying.</p><p>"I remember thinking, 'Ben's going to be on his own with this baby I’ll never get to hold or see,'" she writes, adding that the sound of the baby crying made her keep fighting. She calls it the "best noise I’ve ever heard in my life," and says hearing Haggard speaking to her through her fog also kept her going.</p><p>"I really believe that the love I heard from him and the love I have for my baby boy pulled me through," she states.</p><p>The baby is home now and doing well, and Beyzade is requesting some private time with her family after her ordeal. "I hope every one understands," she writes. "This has been the largest event in our lives, good and bad... the angels were with us and I am so glad I can be here to love Ben and baby Liam&nbsp;— forever."</p><p><strong>See the Cutest Baby Bumps in Country Music</strong></p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Next: See Which Country Stars Welcomed Babies in 2017</a><p><strong>The Coolest Baby Names in Country Music</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpp2iobJutMCgnpqqlGLAsLqMm5ynZZiWtKit0Z1km5mSrnqju9hmmqiloKG2pK3Toqanq18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pictured-tiny-chapel-channel-islands-measures-just-16ft-9ft-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pictured: The tiny chapel in the Channel Islands that measures just 16ft by 9ft</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./200306251021965.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>JOHN MALKOVICH TURNS FASHION DESIGNER WITH MRS MUDD</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
