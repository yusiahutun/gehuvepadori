Jaye, who portrayed the transgender role&nbsp;in&nbsp;The Crying Game,&nbsp;didn't have expected that he would find the love of his life, and someone would adore him too.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Fortunately, Jaye's gay partner, Thomas Clarke held his hand. The two shared the wedding vows with each other in July 2017. Meanwhile, his gay-bride was quick to give a glimpse of his romantic nuptial on social media, as he officiated his marriage through&nbsp;Instagram caption "Just married." The mingled couple celebrated their wedlock slicing a beautiful wedding cake. His family members, brother, and dad were also present as guests. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-184 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><span style=color:#00f><img alt height=333 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikinetworth.com/uploads/Jaye-anniversary-Thomas.JPG width=450 ezimgfmt="rs rscb2 src ng ngcb2" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Jaye celebrated the first anniversary with his partner, Thomas Clarke, on&nbsp;16 July 2018.

Even his lover Fergus is unaware of his true identity. The thriller genre movie excellently captures the issues of gender, race, and sexuality. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>The director Neil Jordan says no one other male actor could bring perfection in the role as a female like Jaye has done in the movie. He has seen his brilliant acting skills during the audition and captivated the director in his first attempt. Jaye, 50, is different from his transgender character, he is a gay man but not a transgender, but still, he does justice to the character.</p><h2 dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>What Is Jaye Doing Now?</h2><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>After some of the best performances in the film industry, maybe he did not want to be in front of the cameras forever, so he returned to his modeling and fashion designing career.
