He faced many challenges in his early life, including being born to a teenage mother and having an absent father. However, with the help of<strong> Frank Walker</strong>, a football coach, and his family, James was able to turn his life around.</p><p>James lived with the Walkers during the weekdays and with his mother on weekends. This arrangement allowed him to focus on his education and basketball skills. He joined a traveling AAU youth basketball team and continued to excel in the sport.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/e00-marca.uecdn.es/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2023/11/09/16995649447370.png><p>James never forgot the impact that the <strong>Walkers</strong> had on his life. He expressed his gratitude on Instagram, saying: "'356 Hillwood' will always be a part of my legacy! Saved my life! Literally saved me." He also wrote about his experience in the book "<strong>LeBron James: The Making of an MVP</strong>," saying that living with the Walkers was an "unbelievable experience" that opened his eyes to become the person he is today.</p><p>The Walkers not only helped James with his education and basketball skills but also provided him with a stable family environment. Before living with the Walkers, James missed more than half of his class days in a school year. However, with their help, he was able to attend school regularly and excel academically.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Now the coach is one of James' business partner</h2><p><strong>Frank Walker Jr.</strong>, one of James' oldest and closest friends, is now his business partner. They opened the clothing store "Unknwn" in Miami, Florida, and later in Akron, Ohio. James' success in business is a testament to the impact that the Walkers had on his life.</p><p>Despite his success, James has not forgotten his roots. He has used his platform to give back to his community through the <strong>LeBron James Foundation</strong>. His "I Promise" school and housing project have helped many kids in need.</p><p>Many children have been inspired by James' success and generosity. In interviews, some of them have been speechless when asked about the basketball player's impact on their lives. James' legacy is not just about his accomplishments on the court but also about passing forward Frank Walker's generosity and kindness.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jpuYrKOVqa%2BiuMtopZuZX6G8tHnAp56epJWoeq2typ6prGdiZX90e5BqZmlxX2uCdbCTnmqbamJrfXKwkJprbnCSaYKigo2hq6ak</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./piglet-by-lottie-hazell-review-appetite-for-destruction.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Piglet by Lottie Hazell review appetite for destruction</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kate-middleton-autumn-outfit-sweater-vest.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kate Middleton's cosy sweater vest and trousers</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
