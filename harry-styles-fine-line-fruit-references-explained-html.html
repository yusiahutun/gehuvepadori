Lots of cake. No kiwis. This time around, Styles is not messing around with the fruit. Two songs on his second studio album, <a href=#>Fine Line</a> (out today!), are named after fruit, the lyrics are full of references, and each of the pits for his world tour are named “Watermelon” and “<a href=#>Cherry</a>.” What does it all mean? To be fair, even Harry doesn’t know where the references are coming from. “They seem to be happening by accident, then when I kind of put the album together at the end, I realized there is a lot of fruit on this album,” he said on C<a href=#>apital FM</a>. Maybe it’s his subconscious warning him against scurvy? Let’s peel back the fruit and see what’s actually going on.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck44dyo80001g3h679tw7jqmp@published>“Watermelon Sugar”</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck44dyet600163h679o4a2v7h@published data-word-count=8>“<a href=#>Watermelon Sugar</a>” gets to the good stuff immediately.</p><p>“Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin’ / And it sounds just like a song / I want moreberriesand that summerfeelin’ / It’s so wonderful and warm”</p><p><br></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck44dze6n00213h67bj0410o4@published data-word-count=86>What isn’t strawberry but tastes like strawberries? Hmm. Almost as soon as the song came out, fans clocked that “Watermelon Sugar” has an alternate meaning that would not get the green light if he was still in One Direction. Zane Lowe, from Apple Music Beats 1 Radio, puts it best. According to him, “Watermelon Sugar” is about “the joys of mutually appreciated oral pleasure.” But Harry <a href=#>refused to admit</a> that “Watermelon Sugar” is a dirty, dirty sex song. He has an image to uphold, you know?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck44dzffl002b3h678odhz5vm@published data-word-count=77>The chorus is just Harry wailing “Watermelon sugar high” over and over again, almost as if in ecstasy. Then, later in the song, he’s absolutely begging for a little more sweetness with “I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it / <a href=#>Watermelon sugar high</a>.” Not only is “Watermelon Sugar” Harry Styles’s most fruit-forward song, it’s also his sexiest song ever. We saw the “Lights Up” music video and we still didn’t see “Watermelon Sugar” coming.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck44e1xaq002k3h67q1uje712@published>“Adore You”</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck44e280d002u3h67myi1h9sa@published data-word-count=72>In Fine Line’s third single, “Adore You,” Harry references different fruit to describe the joy he feels when he’s around this particular girl. He calls it a “strawberry-lipstick state of mind,” which immediately conjures the image of Glossier lip-gloss ads. It could mean lips stained from eating too many strawberries, red lipstick, or, if we’re basing this on the definitions “Watermelon Sugar” created, Harry could be referencing his favorite pastime, oral sex.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck44e2dgn00343h675ful0616@published data-word-count=68>In the second verse, Harry sings “Brown skin and lemon over ice,” a summertime vision. Nothing good comes from looking up “lemon over ice.” It’s all extremely vulgar Urban Dictionary definitions that we’re hoping — praying — Harry isn’t invoking on “Adore You.” This lyric can be taken way more literally. A nice lemonade with your girl on a sunny day? Who wouldn’t think that’s a miniature heaven?</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck44e2or6003d3h67aubfptma@published>“Cherry”</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck44e2t7a003n3h67l571bwso@published data-word-count=121>The title of Harry Styles’s breakup song fits perfectly with the album’s fruit motif, but it actually has nothing to do with fruit. The song “Cherry,” for which the Cherry Pit is named, never once mentions the little red fruit. That’s because “Cherry” isn’t actually a fruit reference. <a href=#>It’s a reference to his former main squeeze.</a> It’s a combination of Harry Styles’s and Camila Rowe’s (his ex-girlfriend) names. Technically, it’s “Charry,” but that just isn’t as cute as Cherry. Harry wrote the song while feeling “<a href=#>not great</a>” about their breakup. It gets at all the awful, jealous, and yearning feelings that come after being dumped. Think about that while standing in the Cherry Pit at Madison Square Garden. Not so fun.</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ck44bgrfb00tm2cy69n8borql@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Everything We Know About Harry Styles’s Ex-Girlfriend, Based on Fine Line</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ck42zbl8f002i2cy6h6j1sh57@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Harry Styles Exposes Himself (in More Ways Than One) in These Fine Line Photos</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>How Many Times Does Harry Styles Mention Fruit on Fine Line?</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlocmdhZ3yprdGrsGarpK65pr%2BMn6CnnV2htq%2BxjJ%2BprqGkYr%2BmssSrnKeblah6psTPpZiippWZe6nAzKU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-wear-culottes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Wear Culottes Like a Fashion Pro</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./william-butler-yeats-think-where-mans-glory-most-begins-and-ends-and-say-my-glory-was-i-had-such-friends.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>William Butler Yeats: 'Think where man's glory most begins and ends, and say my glory was I had such</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
