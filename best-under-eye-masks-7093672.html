They’re a great intro into the world of skincare, but because of that there are countless options available.

Puffy eyes can be the result of dehydration so the hyaluronic acid (along with drinking enough water!) add back in the necessary hydration.

Dieux Skin Forever Eye Masks are reusable silicone eye patches that can be worn over and over again (over 1000 times to be exact). After going through your regular skin routine, apply your favorite eye cream or serum to your skin, then place the masks over top — they will ensure your skin products stay in place, and actually increase absorption so you can get the most out of your skincare. After about 20 minutes, you can remove them, rinse, and then place them back in their case.</p><p>To ensure they stay sanitary and in pristine condition, you’ll want to clean them after each use.

When I’m feeling extra parched, I always look to these masks to quench my under-eyes thirst. They’re full of hydrating ingredients including glycerin and hyaluronic acid, which both draw moisture into the area to help under-eyes look and feel more hydrated. Additionally, these masks also contain caffeine to soothe and de-puff, and marshmallow root extract to soften skin.</p><p>Since these eye masks are larger than others and have a gel texture, they’re not the best at staying in place. Also, the size makes them difficult to place, especially if you have more of a petite facial structure. I recommend cutting them to better fit your face (plus, you’ll be left with more patches in the end).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Hyaluronic acid, Marshmallow root extract, and Caffeine<strong> </strong>|<strong> Benefits: </strong>Hydrates | <strong>Count</strong>: 30 pairs</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-eye-bags-winky-lux-wakey-wakey-hydrogel-eye-patches></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Eye Bags</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Winky Lux Hydrogel Eye Patches</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Winky Lux Wakey Wakey Hydrogel Eye Patches" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/v098VEpHGI2-q2zT_jAa5tguT3k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Winky-Lux-Wakey-Wakey-Hydrogel-Eye-Patches-8b0a8d2eafd84b6c8a314aa1b9f11390.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Woke up with serious eye bags?

But if you do have specific concerns, you’ll want to keep an eye out for certain ingredients to get the results you want. “Hyaluronic acid, retinol, vitamin C, and caffeine are some of my top essentials when it comes to eye masks,” says Taylor Worden, celebrity esthetician and founder of Taylor Worden Skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If your under-eye area tends to dry out, Worden recommends looking for eye masks infused with hyaluronic acid, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Hydra-Gel Eye Patches</a>. This water-binding ingredient attracts moisture into the skin to hydrate and plump the area. While hyaluronic acid also helps to reduce fine lines and wrinkles, opt for eye masks with retinol for longer-lasting results (we like <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Patchology FlashPatch Restoring Night Eye Gels</a>).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On the other hand, to combat dark circles look for patches that contain vitamin C, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Pixi BeautifEYE Brightening Eye Patches</a>.

Gel eye patches are great because the serum sits on top, which allows it to seamlessly sink into skin rather than staying stuck on the eye patch material. However, gel textures have a tendency to slide down your face, so you may want to lay down while wearing them to ensure they stay in place.</p><p>If you hate when eye patches slip and slide around your face, opt for fabric masks, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Kat Burki KB5 Eye Recovery Masks</a>. This material has a good grip and will stay in place while wearing. Foil, on the other hand, doesn't really affect the staying power of the mask itself, but it locks in heat and moisture, so masks with foil finishes are ideal if you really want to see near immediate results because the serum underneath is less likely to evaporate.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h3><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you apply under eye patches?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The most important part of the application process is preparing the eye area — you want to ensure that your face is totally clean before placing an under-eye mask on your face. “After removing all makeup and dirt, gently apply the under-eye patches,” says Jeannette Graf, M.D., board-certified dermatologist and Assistant Clinical Professor of Dermatology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine.

If they’re in a packet, carefully slide them out and grab the thickest part of the patch, then apply to your face.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do under eye patches work?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“All patches work by adding a layer of hydration to the skin and then covering it with an occlusive material,” said <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Nicole Hayre, M.D.</a>, a Virginia-based board-certified dermatologist.
