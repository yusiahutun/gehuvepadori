But perhaps her most coveted look of all? Her signature wispy bangs. The popularity of Birkin bangs has ebbed and flowed over the years, but we’re certainly riding the wave right now.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I believe the resurgence of this style of bangs has much to do with the world’s obsession with Wednesday star <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jenna Ortega</a>, who rocks the look,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Castillo Bataille</a>, hairstylist and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Matrix</a> brand ambassador. "Her character in the show and real life is a vibe and energy we all want to have."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another modern-day celeb that has given the Birkin bang a resurgence is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Anne Hathaway</a>, who brought them back while paying homage to her character in The Devil Wears Prada after her character gets her makeover. And in recent years, "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Dakota Johnson</a> has been the ultimate poster child for the Birkin bang, pairing them with her effortless style. For me, [that combo] is a chef’s kiss,” says <a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Jae-Manuel Cardenas</a>, senior stylist at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>Sally Hershberger NoMad</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Already convinced that you want to try out this Birkin bangs? Here's what you need to know.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-birkin-bangs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are Birkin Bangs?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jane's variation of bangs was “a short, blunt style that landed just above the brows with thinner ends," says Bataille. "My favorite thing about these bangs is that they require less hair than normal blunt bangs."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the newer take isn't as short as Birkin's original fringe, the concept of having blunt, wispy ends remains. Another upside: "This technique leaves more texture and dimension around the face,” he says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-who-should-try-them></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Who Should Try Them</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“This style works well with those that have thin, straight hair. That doesn’t mean all other textures are out! These bangs can be cut into any texture. The final look will still give the same effect and vibe,” says Bataille.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re getting bangs cut from scratch, it’s always best to go a tad longer than you think you need to make sure the hair doesn’t bounce up too much — then have your stylist cut more as needed.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-ask-your-stylist></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Ask Your Stylist</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As with any new hairstyle or cut, “it’s best to bring in a photo reference of someone with a similar face shape and hair texture to yours wearing the style that you want,” says Cardenas. "This helps make sure you and your hairstylist are on the same page."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your stylist should know what to do from there, but when they’re talking you through the process, you can “ask them to thin out the ends a bit. Also, ask not to open up the face too much," says Bataille. "The idea is to keep the bang area tight and flirty to the face — this bang style is a bit different from a normal blunt bang. The width of these bangs should stay fairly tight to the eyes and brows, and the ends should be thin and wispy."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-style-birkin-bangs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Style Birkin Bangs</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Style these bangs with a round brush and a ping-pong size amount of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Matrix Setter Mousse</a>. The hold will keep these bangs in place with a natural, carefree finish,” says Bataille.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It’s also important to maintain the wispiness of the look as Jane did: “Make sure not your bangs aren’t styled too round or ‘bubbly’ — you want them to be on the straighter side. Otherwise it would feel like a different bang,” adds Cardenas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To achieve that coveted piece-y style that characterizes the look, try <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Sally Hershberger 24K Superiority Complex Texturizing Paste</a>. On days when your hair and face feel extra oily or you’re skipping a wash, keep an oil-absorbing product handy like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Living Proof Perfect hair Day Advanced Clean Dry Shampoo</a>.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-maintenance-is-like></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Maintenance Is Like</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though Birkin bangs may look effortless, keep in mind that all bangs do require a bit of extra work to be styled daily to get them to look the way you want them to. However, the payoff is worth it: “Birkin bangs, when done correctly, can totally transform your face with the right shape,” says Cardenas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Maintenance will also include “a regular bang trim every few weeks to keep them at the perfect length,” adds Cardenas. Luckily, when you’re ready to grow them out, this style makes the process easy. “These bangs are cut using a smaller guideline with less weight at the ends, making them easier to grow out than other bang styles,” says Bataille. "They simply blend back into the hair in the future."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57waKppKGeYq%2BiusasZHBtYG5%2Bd4E%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chicago-firearms-safety-instructor-61-accidentally-shoots-dead-wife-60-cleaning-gun-turns-weapon-himself-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chicago firearms safety instructor, 61, accidentally shoots dead his wife, 60, while cleaning his gu</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./i-travel-world-naked-public-31227550.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'I travel the world and get naked in public but trolls think it's Photoshop'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
