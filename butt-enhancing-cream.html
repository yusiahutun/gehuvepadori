But while wearing sundresses, shorts and tank tops keeps up feeling cool and comfortable, by offering glimpses of dimpled skin, a bloated belly or a saggy bust, they can also sap our confidence. Check out these tips that target warm-weather body woes—&nbsp;stat.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>For A Dazzling Rear</h2><p>From a droopy tush to ingrown hairs, baring your backside in a bathing suit with confidence may seem like it’s beyond reach. But these easy tips will make flaunting your rear view a cinch.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Lift The Bum</h3><p>Thanks to gravity, our derriere dips lower with each birthday. The cream that social media influencers swear by to perk it up fast: Sol de Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum Cream (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Sol De Janeiro, $10</a>). It’s made with the Brazilian fruit extract guarana, which contains <a href=# rel=noopener>more caffeine than coffee</a>, says New York City dermatologist <a href=# rel=noopener>Dendy Engelman, MD</a>. “Guarana ‘wakes up’ circulation, creating firmer skin for a lifted appearance.” Plus, the butt enhancing cream’s shimmery mica particles leave the tush with a youthful glow. Tip: Apply to your bum in a circular motion (this <a href=# rel=noopener>increases circulation</a> for faster absorption).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Diminish Dimples</h3><p>To knock out cellulite around the rear, try the DIY “jelly” mask made popular on Instagram. To do: Mix 1 tablespoon of unflavored gelatin (its <a href=# rel=noopener>collagen absorbs into skin</a> for a plumping effect that “fills in” dimples), 1 tablespoon of water, and 1 tablespoon of coconut oil (its <a href=# rel=noopener>fatty acids tighten skin</a> to “shrink” dimples). Apply onto cellulite-prone areas and let sit for 10 minutes; rinse.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Eliminate Ingrowns</h3><p>The key to nixing those inflamed bumps on the back of our upper thighs? TikTok creators are touting the ease of a quick scrub that gently removes the dead, dry skin that traps the hairs in. To do: Mix ½ cup of sugar, ⅓ cup of olive oil, and ¼<strong> </strong>teaspoon of turmeric together in a jar; gently scrub the mix onto ingrowns while in the shower. The sugar’s granules slough off skin, olive oil’s <a href=# rel=noopener>fatty acids re-moisturize skin</a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener>turmeric fights inflammation</a> due to bacterial buildup.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>For A Beautiful Bust</h2><p>If your summer wardrobe is filled with support-lacking swimsuits and crepiness-revealing tank tops, no need to toss them. Here’s help.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Erase Crepey Chest Skin</h3><p>Praise for the <a href=#>anti-aging benefits of “slugging”</a> (slathering on a petrolatum-based ointment before bed) is all over TikTok. Slugging locks moisture deep into skin’s layers, which helps diminish wrinkles overnight, says Florida-based dermatologist <a href=# rel=noopener>Marianna Blyumin Karasik, MD</a>. She suggests using CeraVe Healing Ointment for best results (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Walmart, $19.88</a>). Its ceramides create a moisture-retaining barrier in skin while its hyaluronic acid helps plump it up to reveal a smoother chest by morning. To do: Slather the chest with the ointment before bed, then rinse it off in the a.m.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Boost A Saggy Bosom</h3><p>The sticky secret to perking up boobs <a href=#>in a bathing suit</a>? Wearing wash-and-wear sticker cups, like PADRAM Silicone Invisible Lift Up Bra underneath it, say TikTokers (<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Buy from Amazon, $19.99</a>). To do: Simply place on the breast (the silicone cups create a sticky suction), then lift the tab —and the boobs — up; stick in place. Tip: Sprinkle baking powder on skin before applying for added grip.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Calm A Boob Rash</h3><p>High temperatures or exposure to too much sun can lead to an itchy rash across the chest or along the bra line. The remedy that YouTubers turn to? A cornstarch and tea tree oil mix. “Cornstarch <a href=# rel=noopener>absorbs any moisture</a> harboring rash-causing bacteria,” says Dr. Engelman. “And <a href=# rel=noopener>antiseptic tea tree oil</a> fights off bacteria to reduce redness and itching.” To do: Mix ½ tablespoon of cornstarch and 2 drops of tea tree oil and apply to rash before bed; rinse in the morning.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>For An Amazing Midsection</h2><p>Catching sight of saggy skin, stretch marks, and bloat make you hesitant to reveal your midsection? These tips will help you bare it happily.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>De-Bloat The Belly</h3><p>Whether those belly-swelling fluids accumulated from a sluggish lymph or those salty snacks at last night’s barbecue, to the rescue: <a href=# rel=noopener>#LegsUpTheWall</a>, the de-bloating pose social media influencers are obsessed with. This pose works by enhancing circulation and improving digestion to <a href=# rel=noopener>ease bloat in minutes</a>. To do: Lie on your back on the floor and prop your legs up against a wall for 10 minutes.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Firm Saggy Tummy-Skin</h3><p>Videos showing the belly-firming results of <a href=# rel=noopener>dry brushing abound on TikTok</a> — many report seeing a difference after one session. Why it works: “The brushing helps stimulate blood circulation, lymphatic drainage, and collagen production to <a href=# rel=noopener>tighten and tone loose skin</a>,” says <a href=# rel=noopener>Cameron Rokhsar, MD</a>, a professor of dermatology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. “It also exfoliates dead cells, promoting the growth of new ones for firmer, tighter skin.” To do: Starting above the belly button, make small, firm, strokes with a brush like EcoTools Smoothing Dry Body Brush (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Ulta, $5.99</a>) up toward the heart for 2 minutes. Repeat on the lower abdomen, sweeping down toward the feet for 2 minutes.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Erase Stretch Marks</h3><p>The stretch mark–busting trick trending on Instagram: washing skin with an exfoliating <a href=# rel=noopener>Korean washcloth made of viscose</a> (it stimulates cell turnover), then applying Bio-Oil (its <a href=# rel=noopener>vitamin A supports collagen</a> and elastin production and its <a href=# rel=noopener>vitamin E keeps skin soft</a> and pliable) right after. Together, they reduce the appearance of stretch marks, stat. To do: Add body wash to a cloth, like The Original Korean Washcloth (<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Buy from Amazon, $5.97 for pack of four</a>); scrub stretch marks in circular motions for 1 minute. Towel off and rub a pea-size amount of Bio-Oil (<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Buy from Amazon, $10.14</a>) onto the area.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>For Lovely Legs</h2><p>We can’t wait to feel the light summer breeze on our bare legs. To keep hassles like chub rub and ankle swelling from sapping joy, try these hacks.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>End Thigh Chafing</h3><p>The friction between your thighs when donning shorts or skirts can lead to a painful, bumpy rash. Add salty summer sweat to the mix and ouch! Look to Instagram-favorite Gold Bond Clear Body Powder Spray (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Walmart, $7.97</a>) for relief. The powder’s anti-inflammatory and antiseptic ingredients like aloe, ginger root extract, and tapioca starch create a soothing barrier on skin, allowing thighs to glide sans irritation while also healing any prior chafing. Bonus: The cool spray helps relieve stinging on contact.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Shrink Swollen Ankles</h3><p>Standing or even sitting for prolonged periods, especially amid a heat wave, can cause fluids to pool in legs, resulting in the dreaded cankles. The TikTok trend that can help in no time: rolling an icy facial roller, like PASNOWFU Ice Cube Face Roller (<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Buy from Amazon, $8.99</a>) filled with cucumber and aloe over ankles. The potent anti-inflammatory mix of aloe, cucumber, and ice tightens leaky blood vessels and <a href=# rel=noopener>reduces inflammatory factors</a> in the fluid to de-puff ankles. To do: Remove the roller’s top and fill the bottom with thin cucumber slices. Snap the top back into place. Mix 3 parts aloe vera gel and 1 part water and pour into the hole in the roller’s top; place in the freezer. Once frozen, rub onto ankles in a circular motion for 5 minutes.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Heal Cracked Heels</h3><p>Sandals and flip-flops expose tootsies to summer’s high heat and dry air, depleting moisture, which can lead to painful cracks on the heels. The viral solution that works: Cut an orange in half and sprinkle with ½ tsp. of Himalayan salt. Rub the orange against each heel to remove dry skin, then rinse. Mineral-laden Himalayan salt’s microbeads <a href=# rel=noopener>slough off the top layer of damaged skin</a>, while the vitamin C and citric acid in a fresh orange <a href=# rel=noopener>reveal new skin</a>, and its antioxidants help repair and smooth cracks. For fastest results, do before bed, then slather heels with moisturizer and cover with socks.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>For Fabulous Arms</h2><p>Wave bye-bye to mood-dampening arm woes with these simple tricks to flawless skin.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Soften ‘Strawberry Skin’</h3><p>Those tiny red bumps that create a strawberry-like look on our upper arms are caused by an overproduction of keratin that <a href=# rel=noopener>clogs hair follicles</a>. TikTok <a href=# rel=noopener>videos show users</a> unclogging and buffing these bumps away with a tool you most likely already have on hand: a pumice stone. Bonus! When bumps are gone, arms may appear slimmer too! To do: Wet skin, then add a little body wash to the stone, and gently rub against bumps; rinse.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Brighten Underarms</h3><p>Our <a href=# rel=noopener>armpits can darken</a> from dead skin and toxin buildup or an overproduction of skin pigment. Luckily, a quick scroll through Instagram, and you’ll be bombarded with “armpit detox” masks. Thanks to <a href=# rel=noopener>bentonite clay</a> (its negative charge attracts positively charged toxins that build up) and <a href=# rel=noopener>apple cider vinegar</a> (its lactic acid helps shed dead, darkened cells and its acetic acid brightens skin), the mask will lighten armpits fast. To do: Mix 1 tablespoon of bentonite clay, like Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Walmart, $9.98</a>), 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar, and ½ teaspoon of water. Apply to underarms and let sit for 20 minutes; rinse.</p><p>Click through for a complete guide to our <a href=# rel=noopener>lymphatic diet for weight loss</a> for easy ways to unblock your lymph system so that cellulite, jiggly fat and bloat just fall off.</p><p>First For Women aims to feature only the best products and services.
