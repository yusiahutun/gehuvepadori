In the caption, he wrote, "Dad Bod" followed by a biceps emoji.</p><p>His followers, however, seemed to take offense in the fact that he called his chiseled body a "dad bod." Many of the comments were from those who were upset at him for doing so.</p><p>"Not a dad bod, not old enough to be a dad. Call me when you cross the 40 threshold!" said one. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>When someone else countered saying Mattson already had two kids, he said the traditional definition of a "dad bod" did not fit his body.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Someone else asked, "In what reality is this dad bod?" Replying to this response, another added&nbsp;saying, "A land of disillusionment."</p><p>There were many others who denied his body was a fit for the dad bod category of body types. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>This wasn't the first time Mattson has posted pictures with the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">same caption</a>. However, this was the only time he got considerable backlash. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It might have been these responses that prompted Mattson to clarify his position on the argument.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>On January 19, he uploaded a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">few pictures</a> on his Instagram and Facebook with a long caption. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>"Some people don't realize that I've been modeling longer than I've been a dad," Mattson began the caption.</p><p>He then claimed that men, more so than women,&nbsp;being the biggest targets of body shaming and bans, was not the indicator for social equality and self-love.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In the next line, he made it clear that he was not attacking&nbsp;any gender. But he wished that everyone was held to the same standard when posting online.</p><p>Regardless of whether it is a man or a woman posting about something they are proud of, in this case, their bodies, Mattson demanded equality in scrutiny and judgment. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Ending his writing, he requested everyone ask&nbsp;him about his story before hating him or making uninformed judgments.</p><p>"E.L.E. everybody love everybody," he wrote at the end.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2 id=Chase+Mattson+Deleted+His+Caption+on+IG name=Chase+Mattson+Deleted+His+Caption+on+IG>Chase Mattson Deleted His Caption on IG</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Mattson's post gathered a lot of traction on Instagram. He received many comments, both agreeing and disagreeing with his sentiments.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The first one of those supporters was his fiancee, Stankus. "I love you," she expressed. "Proud of you," accompanied by a red heart emoji.</p><p>Another model, Michael Yerger, too showed his support. He said that Instagram didn't let him post pictures of his Dolce & Gabbana campaign.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>There were people who also disagreed with his claims. Women came at him saying he was wrong to claim that men's bodies were more sexualized than women's bodies. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Following some backlash in the comment section, Mattson removed his entire caption.</p><p>He replaced his words with two emojis, implying he was keeping quiet now.</p><p>However, the deleted caption is still up&nbsp;in his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook post</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After this, he uploaded another post where he answered some of the questions fans asked about him.</p><p>Here, he revealed that he was a 27-year-old model with two daughters, and had been modeling since he was 18.</p><p></p><p><strong>Chase Mattson with his two daughters.</strong> (Photo: Chase Mattson/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>Talking about movies, he said he wanted to be a lead in a Marvel or DC movie â€” didn't matter if he was a hero or a villain. His favorite movies were&nbsp;Interstellar, Saving Private Ryan, and <a href=# rel=follow>Gladiator</a>.</p><p>He then revealed things about his private life, admitting that he had never been engaged or married before meeting&nbsp;Stankus.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Mattson and Stankus <a href=# rel="follow noopener">got engaged</a> on December 12, 2020, in the most romantic way possible in Malibu.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>As of September 2021, the couple was <a href=# rel=follow>getting ready</a> for a wedding and a baby.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In their plans, the wedding is&nbsp;happening in 2022.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJuYlsCmecyaq62rn6N6tLTIq6ulnaOoeqO7w7JloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./article-694e81c6-14f2-11ed-b07f-d7ca07976ac7-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ground broken on Laurel Welcome Center | Free News</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./beloved-actor-zack-norman-dies-as-fans-say-his-memory-is-a-blessing-his-legacy-lives-on.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Beloved actor Zack Norman dies as fans say his 'memory is a blessing' - 'His legacy lives on'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
