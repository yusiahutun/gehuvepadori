"I run or hike 20 miles a week and I lift weights. It's a big commitment for me. I basically live in workout clothes so I can get it in."</p><p>"The Mindy Project" alum -- who is mom to daughter Katherine, 5, and son Spencer, 2, -- opened up about her collaboration with Andie Swim, sharing that the swimwear pieces make her feel "young and carefree" and that many women -- including moms -- can feel good as well.</p><p>"It's not like you become a mom and you give up on looking cute and sexy and all you want to wear is a modest navy bathing suit," Kaling explained. "I don't need to have a skirted bathing suit. These pieces make me feel young and carefree -- they're not too revealing, they give me support where I need it and the colors are gorgeous."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>"I'm not someone where every piece of clothing is flattering on me," she added. "I am curvy and I have big thighs, and the collection is great for my body type. And I think a lot of women will like it for themselves as well."</p><p>See Kaling model in full collection in the gallery, above!</p><p>Meanwhile, People later told Kaling that she's in what they described as her "Hot Mindy Era" due to her recent fashion choices.</p><p>"When you say it like that, it does make me feel even hotter!" she said in reply. "I'm feeling really confident in my body these days, which is not something that I've been able to say for my whole life, unfortunately. And I really do love the ease with which I can get dressed in the morning. It doesn't take me a long time to get ready, which I love. And I feel great."</p><p>Kaling's collection with Andie Swim includes 33 items and retails from $52 to $128.</p><p>Per Andie, "The collection was designed with inclusivity top of mind and caters to all body types, with sizes ranging from XXS to XXXL. Mindy, a longtime fan of Andie, worked closely with the brand to ensure the collection is stylish, comfortable, and fits across every body type."</p><p>The Mindy x Andie collection is available now on <a href=#>AndieSwim.com</a>.</p><a id=gallery-link-32a0aee3-851b-46e9-87c7-0ba24102b708 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:32a0aee3-851b-46e9-87c7-0ba24102b708 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:8474bf8e-d1bb-4fe7-b8b9-e271e445a646 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7c/4by3/2023/12/13/7cb3f58c59794b7d86a7287f42dbee28_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j25mamhforavsNhmopqkmaO0bsDApaKsZaeatqi002ajqKujYsGzrc2snaiqnZbBqrvNZqSonJWhwG66xLBkrK%2BZosSmrdFmmqiknJqwtbXOp2Y%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./outlook-significantly-brighter-hong-kong-stocks-us5-trillion-market-attracts-global-investors.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Outlook significantly brighter for Hong Kong stocks, as US$5 trillion market attracts global i</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-lopez-massive-bathroom-next-level-stunning.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>J.Lo gave fans a glimpse at her massive bathroom - and its next level stunning</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
