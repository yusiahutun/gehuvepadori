Returning after a long production halt due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the glamorous real estate brokerage had lots of changes to catch us up on, so many that some of the drama didn't even make it into season 4 (*cough* Chrishell and Jason *cough*).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Luckily, Netflix knew that we would want new episodes sooner rather than later. After concurrently filming seasons 4 and 5, the streamer announced that the show is returning this spring with new drama, a new in-house relationship, and even a new realtor. Here's what we know about season 5 so far.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Season 5 premieres on April 22, 2022.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Netflix announced the season 5 premiere date in March, and followed up this week with a new trailer (seen above). The clip shows <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a38951327/selling-sunset-chrishell-stause-under-construction-interview/?utm_source=pocket_mylist" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Chrishell Stause" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Chrishell Stause</a> and Jason Oppenheim enjoying the early days of their relationship in Greece, later showing several of the realtors expressing both positive and negative feelings about the relationship. While Mary Fitzgerald says, "I would love it if Chrishell and Jason got married, Christine opines out loud, "I was wondering why I wasn't getting listings, but I was like, oh yeah, it's because I'm not f***ing my boss."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We're also introduced to a new cast member, British realtor Chelsea Lazkani, who has her eye on a spot at the brokerage and becomes fast friends with Christine. However, the two-minute clip also shows that the Oppenheim Group may be planning to downsize, with new manager Fitzgerald asking at the end, "Is this the end for her?"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Netflix renewed the hit reality show for seasons 4 and 5 at the same time in March 2021. The timeline between the season 5 teaser and the full trailer suggests that production on the new episodes soon after season 4. The show has already followed that schedule once: seasons 2 and 3 filmed concurrently and were dropped within three months of each other.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Chrishell Stause even shared a behind-the-scenes at season 5 soon after the season 4 premiere, posting what appears to be an on-set pic with new cast member <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a38370217/selling-sunset-emma-hernan-interview/?utm_source=pocket_mylist" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Emma Hernan" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Emma Hernan</a>. She captioned the post, which also includes outfit pics, "Look from Season 5 of #SellingSunset."</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Chrishell Stause and Jason Oppenheim's relationship will be a main storyline.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Selling Sunset season 4 ended with a surprise coda, a sneak peek at the drama that will fuel the upcoming season. Most of the teaser focused on the casts' reactions to Stause and Oppenheim's relationship, which was <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a37158830/chrishell-stause-and-jason-oppenheim-are-dating-selling-sunset/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="revealed to the world" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">revealed to the world</a> during the cast's Grecian holiday last July.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It turns out that the cameras were also on during the trip, with the teaser starting out with shots of Greece as Hernan says, "Did you guys hear the news?" In what appears to be a reaction (though we can't be sure with reality TV editing), Heather Rae Young says, "It's insane to me." Young adds, "So weird, though. It's like exciting, but so..." before Davina Potratz chimes in, "I'm not getting into that."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Besides the surprised reactions, we see a peek at a conversation between Stause and Fitzgerald, who previously dated Oppenheim before marrying her husband Romain Bonnet. Stause also speaks up in the clip, saying, "We're not criminals. We're not doing anything wrong," before she and Oppenheim share a kiss.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a38136817/selling-sunset-season-4-secrets/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cosmopolitan UK" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Cosmopolitan UK</a>, Stause opened up about the relationship reveal. "We announced it a little earlier than I would’ve liked to, because I felt like we were about to be outed by paparazzi photos," she revealed. "But I didn’t want people to think it was a mistake or they’d 'caught us' doing something - I wanted to be able to hold my boyfriend’s hand at dinner."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's still unknown whether the end of the Stause and Oppenheim's relationship will also be shown this season, as the couple split up in December 2021. The trailer does show a clip of a family member asking the pair about babies, and the former couple revealed at the time of their breakup that they had "different wants regarding a family."</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Emma Hernan and Vanessa Villela will return for Season 5.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Oppenheim Group welcomed two new realtors this season: former telenovela star Villela and entrepreneur Hernan. The new additions quickly made friends with the rest of the cast, though Hernan also brought along some drama due to her history with Quinn. Hernan and Villela were still with the brokerage at the end of season 4, and both are featured in the new trailer as part of the season.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Netflix also confirmed that the rest of the main cast will return in its <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-doubles-down-on-docusoaps data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="March announcement" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">March announcement</a>, listing Jason and Brett Oppenheim, Chrishell Stause, Christine Quinn, Mary Fitzgerald, Romain Bonnet, Heather Rae Young, Amanza Smith, and Maya Vander, as well as Davina Potratz, who rejoined the brokerage this season.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Christine Quinn says she's in "every single episode" of Season 5.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Quinn's status at the brokerage is a major part of Season 4, with several of the agents upset at the prospect of her return after maternity leave. Even before the season released, fans were wondering whether Quinn was part of the show, since she was absent from some <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/CVQV_Ztl41l/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="group pictures" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">group pictures</a> with the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/CVjtGQkLZ8C/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="rest of the cast" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">rest of the cast</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She addressed the speculation on Twitter last month, assuring that she's still part of the show. "I'm soooo tired of addressing this. I am in every single episode of season 4 and 5 of Selling Sunset. The girls leave me out of photos. I have real work to do besides sit on my phone and prove 24/7 that I’m filming a TV show. Y'all going to see me."</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Chelsea Lazkani is joining the show as a possible ally of Christine.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The British-Nigerian luxury realtor is a former corporate worker who earned her real estate license in 2017 and previously worked at LA's Rodeo Realty. In a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/home/selling-sunset-has-season-5-premiere-date-new-cast-member-chelsea-lazkani/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">People</a> interview, she said that she's ready to re-enter the industry after taking time to raise her two children with husband Jeff Lazkani.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The realtor also told the outlet that she previously knew Jason Oppenheim through her husband, and that the women of Selling Sunset, whom she hadn't met before filming, "really inspired her."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It kind of helps me see my future trajectory by being around so many successful women," she added. "It helps materialize the fact that I can be selling $20 million, $30 million, $40 million homes, seeing other women in close proximity to me doing it."</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/81e105b4-86bd-4dab-a1f8-e00063b9e433_1609381211.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" title="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Quinci LeGardye is an LA-based freelance writer who covers culture, politics, and mental health through a Black feminist lens.
