The do-it-all, MVP ingredient we’re talking about is </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span><a href=# id=auto-tag_vitamin-c data-tag=vitamin-c>vitamin C</a></span></a><span>. It’s an antioxidant that fades dark spots, promotes collagen production and evens skin tone and texture. It essentially helps to make skin look radiant, smooth and youthful. Lucky for you, we have just the product to add to your skincare routine: </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span><a href=# id=auto-tag_exponent-beauty data-tag=exponent-beauty>Exponent Beauty</a>’s Brightening Boost Vitamin C System</span></a>.

Your current bottle of <a href=# id=auto-tag_serum data-tag=serum>serum</a> might be getting less fresh by the day and therefore, less effective, which is why <a href=# rel=noopener>Exponent Beauty</a> created its refillable Self-Activator. This unique packaging maintains the efficacy of the formula and simultaneously minimizes single-use plastic waste. This is a win-win situation for both your skin </span><i><span>and</span></i><span> the planet.</span></p><p><span>We’ll get into the nitty-gritty of how to use the </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Self-Activator</span></a><span>, but for now, hear one shopper’s glowing review of the product.</span></p><p><span>“Wow, this product really is amazing. I saw a difference in my skin even after the first use— brighter and more smooth,” they raved. “The </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>system</span></a><span> is easy to assemble and use, and I like that it can be used with different powders from Exponent.”</span></p><p><span>We love a multifunctional skincare product that produces results almost instantly. Another reviewer said the same thing about how fast the formula works. “The </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>serum</span></a><span> was very hydrating and made my skin feel soft in just one week [of] use. It was gentle on my skin too! Definitely worth trying and [worth] the investment since you get results,” the shopper wrote.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Keep reading for a breakdown of the face serum’s ingredients and how to use the Self Activator. But if you’re already convinced, </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>shop it for 20 percent off</span></a> during the brand’s Great Expectations Event <span>with promo code GREAT20. </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Exponent Beauty’s Black Friday sale</span></a><span> is live now and runs through November 27, so don’t wait up to try the Brightening Boost Vitamin C System. It would also make for the perfect gift for any of your skincare-obsessed friends and family members. They definitely don’t already own anything like it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>RELATED: </b><a href=# rel=noopener><b>It’s Official: These Are The 8 Best Vitamin C Serums You Can Buy, According to Reddit</b></a><b>&nbsp;</b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/exponent-beauty-brightening-boost-vitamin-c-system.jpeg><p><span>We briefly touched on the </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>benefit of vitamin C for your skin</span></a><span>, but brand founder <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Liz Whitman</a> says, “Vitamin C is such a lauded ingredient for its brightening properties, but it’s so precious and degrades rapidly. This was one of the first serums we formulated to test out our self-activated form factor and show that we could deliver peak potency consistently in every…single…dose.”</span></p><p><span>There are several different concentrations of </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>L-ascorbic acid</span></a><span> in skincare formulas, but this serum contains a 10 percent concentration. That’s certainly enough to address all of your sunspots, discoloration, dullness and visible signs of aging. It’s also gentle enough for those with sensitive skin, per the brand. The vitamin C is extra potent in this type of powder form, so we have no doubt you’ll see quick and positive results.</span></p><p><span>On top of </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>vitamin C</span></a><span>, four different molecular weights of </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>hyaluronic acid</span></a><span> deliver hydration deep into your skin’s surface layers. Your skin should appear and feel both plump and moisturized, and your fine lines and wrinkles should be nowhere in sight. The <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hyaluronic Acid Hydrator</a> also makes sure active ingredients work more effectively, meaning the HA boosts the benefits of the vitamin C.</span></p><p><span>If you’re hesitant about the results, these study findings are sure to win you over. After one month of use, 100 percent of subjects saw less noticeable fine lines and wrinkles, along with increased elasticity. Additionally, 72 percent noticed smoother skin texture and 66 percent observed enhanced radiance after one month.</span></p><p><span>These impressive stats definitely have us hooked, and they hopefully have you on board, too.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>All that’s left to do is explain how to use the </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>vitamin C serum</span></a><span>, since it’s part of an entire system that’s unique to the brand. Your set comes with one active powder and refillable powder dispenser, as well as one <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hyaluronic Acid Hydrator</a> and refillable base.</span></p><p><span>First, you want to place your globe and dispenser onto the bowl with the dispenser side facing down. Next, push the globe down and turn it clockwise. You’ll know it’s in correctly once you hear a few clicking noises and a “thunk” sound at 90 degrees. After portioning out your dosage, there should be a single dose of liquid and two piles of powder under your globe. Mix the two for around five seconds and watch as it transforms into a cream-gel serum. Apply the concoction onto your face and neck, followed by cleaning the bowl. Simply wipe it with a tissue between uses, though you could also rinse and air-dry it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For the best results, use the </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Brightening Boost Vitamin C System</span></a><span> in the morning and on clean, damp skin. Just remember to apply it before your moisturizer and sunscreen, and use it after waiting 15 seconds for the serum to fully dissolve. That’s when you know the serum is activated and ready to work wonders on your complexion.</span></p><p><span>The best part is that the Self Activator is compatible with any of </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Exponent Beauty’s active powders</span></a>, <span>meaning you can try the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">retinol</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">resveratrol</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">probiotic enzyme</a> options after you fall in love with the vitamin C one.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Get ready because your skin is about to look so much brighter, smoother and glowy thanks to the </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Brightening Boost Vitamin C System</span></a><span>. It might be a bit of an investment, but the formula, design and results are too good to pass up. Plus, your skin will love it, and the Black Friday sale brings its price down from $166 to $133.</span></p><h2>More Early Black Friday Deals to Shop:</h2><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/banner-newsletter-beauty_july2020.jpg alt="STYLECASTER | Ashley Benson Interview" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1mmpqqlWR%2BdICQcGxpZ5WtvbC6xKerZpqVlsK1xYyvoK2ZnZ67bq%2BMrJyrrZ1k</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./i-tried-amooma-spas-tourmaline-crystal-massage-then-had.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I tried Amooma Spas tourmaline crystal massage then had the best sleep ever</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./little-white-dresses.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>30 Little White Dresses - Shop Short Wedding Dresses</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
