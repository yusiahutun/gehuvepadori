From the coolest clothes worn in movies to film locations around the world, we've got you covered.</p><h2 id=clothes-filmgarb-and-worn-on-tv>1. Clothes: Filmgarb and Worn On TV</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/movie-clothes-featured-on-worn-on-tv-website.jpg><p>Would you like a pair of the iconic sunglasses worn by all the characters in The Matrix? Or maybe you want to look as hot as the cast of Suits. Actors have wardrobe specialists to dress them up, so if you want to imitate their style, head to these movie clothes finder sites.</p><p>Both <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Filmgarb</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Worn On TV</a> have been around for some time now. While Filmgarb covers both movies and TV shows, Worn On TV focuses on popular series and reality shows, such as How I Met Your Father, Dexter, Riverdale, Queens, and The Real Housewives of Potomac.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of the two, Worn On TV is a bit better to browse. You can select the show you want, and even the characters from the show. That will give you a list of photos, and one click will take you to the place to buy it. It's a fantastic website for finding outfits inspired by your favorite TV shows.</p><p>Filmgarb is not that great to browse, but its search function makes up for it. If a movie outfit or an item on a TV show caught your eye, chances are that Filmgarb will tell you the product and where to get it. Most outfits and clothing items are available on Amazon, which makes everything a lot easier.</p><p>In addition to these websites, you can use <a href=#>apps that let you find clothes by picture</a> to help you put together your ideal movie outfit.</p><h2 id=props-propstore>2.

You'll find whole costumes, original artwork, production materials, and more. It even features auctions for special collectibles.</p><p>In terms of props, you can expect a range of items on Propstore for fans of Breaking Bad, Jurassic Park, Assassin's Creed, and even obscure productions like Chronicles of Riddick and Gorillas in the Mist. You're sure to discover unique items on this online store for movie buffs.</p><h2 id=cars-imcdb>3.

Both the big and small screens have immortalized some cars in our memory, like the Gran Torino from Starsky and Hutch or James Bond's Aston Martin DB5. But what about the lesser-known cars?</p><p>Tom Hardy spent the whole of Locke driving a car, but what car was it? What was Mr. Wolf driving in Pulp Fiction? And sometimes, you see a car in the background or a small scene, like the one Keanu Reeves commandeers in Speed.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMCDB </a>can answer any car question from any film. This website is perfect for any gearhead out there well-versed in YouTube channels for car enthusiasts. The IMCDB community scours every frame of a movie to find which vehicles are in it.</p><p>And then it's all listed on the site. Search for the movie, and you'll see snapshots of every point where a new car makes its first appearance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The website doesn't sell you them or point you to a seller, but you'll get enough information to track down the movie car of your dreams.</p><h2 id=food-babish-culinary-universe>4.

He also loves movies and TV shows. So, Rea started a YouTube channel where he recreates famous dishes from what he watches. And as the proverbial cherry on top, he named it <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Babish Culinary Universe</a>, after The West Wing's character Oliver Babish.</p><p>Rea is brilliant at recreating recipes. He pays attention to the description of these fictional items, like Eggs Wodehouse from Archer or Homer Simpson's Moon Waffles. And then he sets about making it in his kitchen, with top-notch 4K video production. Don't watch this one on an empty stomach!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rea's YouTube channel has over 600 videos featuring all sorts of recipes. You'll get to see what it takes to make the black and white cookies from Seinfeld, the biscuits from Ted Lasso, the angel cake from Groundhog Day, Duck Fat Fries from John Wick, and more.</p><p>While you won't find anything about the clothes worn or items used in movies, the videos offer some fantastic cooking tips that will take your recipes to a whole new level.</p><p>Babish Culinary Universe doesn't exactly teach you how to cook. For that, it might be better to check out some <a href=#>visual recipe sites</a>, which are perfect for beginners. You can also use these <a href=#>apps to learn how to bake</a>!</p><h2 id=movie-looks-ellimacs-sfx-makeup>5.

Several channels may do the Grinch, for example, but with different techniques that you can adapt as you wish.</p><p>But there are also artists who consistently post one cool makeup tutorial after another. One such influencer worth following is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ellimacs SFX Makeup</a>, perfect for fans of horror movies and TV shows or Halloween ideas.</p><p>She has 300 videos and counting, including tutorials inspired by The Last of Us, A Nightmare on Elm's Street, Edward Scissorhands, and Gremlins.</p><h2 id=music-whatsong-and-tunefind>6.

While there are <a href=#>music recognition apps that identify songs by tune</a>, you need to be quick to launch the app on your smartphone and let it “listen” before the song ends. If you aren't fast enough, then <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WhatSong</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TuneFind</a> will solve your problem.</p><p>WhatSong, the newer of the two, is all about streaming songs featured in movies and TV shows. It has a relatively good catalog. From trending Netflix series to the latest films, you should be able to find the songs and scores you want.</p><p>TuneFind boasts an even more comprehensive database, covering almost any movie or TV show you can think of. It has also been around for a long time and has an active community of users. It shouldn't fail your search.</p><h2 id=places-movie-locations>7.
