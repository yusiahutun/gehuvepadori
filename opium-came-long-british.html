C. Tsui (South China Morning Post, January 13) was good enough to reply to my letter of December 31. Whilst it was a generally well-reasoned letter, I must take issue with two points.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Firstly, I did not attempt to exculpate the West from being partially responsible for the ills of the less technologically developed countries in the 19th century: I merely stated that it was not a true reflection of recorded history to place all the blame on the West. The Chinese Government of the 19th century was weak, corrupt and inefficient. Its officials, with some notable exceptions, connived in or tacitly allowed the continuation of the opium trade.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Thus China itself must take some of the blame for the evils of that trade being inflicted on its people.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Secondly, Mr Tsui writes that it is ''now accepted throughout the world that the West did systematically introduce (opium) to 'old' China''. Perhaps, but let us look at some historical sources.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Immanuel Hsu in his monumental work The Rise of Modern China, writes that the drug was first reported to have been brought into China by the Arabs or Turks in the eighth century.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was primarily used as medicine at the time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By 1620, however, the practice of smoking opium was taking place in Formosa and by 1660 was widespread in Fukkien and Kwantung provinces.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The taking of the drug had become such a serious problem by 1729 that the Emperor Chia Thing prohibited its consumption by imperial decree.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The decree had little effect. G.B. Endacott in his History of Hong Kong is largely in accord with Mr Hsu although he adds that the smoking of opium had been regarded as a ''serious national problem'' by the T'ang government as early as the 17th century.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This is corroborated by the Encyclopaedia Brittanica.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The importance of these dates is that the first of the several British delegations to Peking was not until 1792, led by Lord McCartney, more than 70 years after the seriousness of the opium problem had been recognised in China and well before the Britishstarted marketing the drug to any noticeable degree.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The lack of understanding on both sides common in these delegations has been, sadly, repeated in the current series of Sino-British talks.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Americans incidentally had to rely on Turkish opium to retain their part of the trade, the British having long had a monopoly on Bengal opium, which was nearer at hand and cheaper.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I do not intend to go into the trade at length: Suffice to say its execution reflected little credit on any of those involved, from whatever side.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To conclude, opium had existed in China a long time before Westerners arrived and, even then, its abuse had become cause for national concern. What the British, and to a lesser extent others, did was to regularise the trade and expand it enormously, causing pain and misery to tens of thousands and huge profits for a few on both sides.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I am in complete accord with Mr Tsui when he suggests we should learn from history to ensure what happened in the past does not happen again, but we must be as clear as possible about what did actually happen and not be misled by historical ''revision''.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Manipulation of history for political purposes is pernicious in the extreme: its intention being to warp the perceptions and outlook of those exposed to it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If we guard against this, perhaps we can get a little closer to Mr Tsui's admirable wish that we should learn to forgive and ensure future harmony.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">WILLIAM GOW The Peak</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdlboN4hY6op6KtnWKwornEZqOoppdir7O106KqoQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tom-march-named-chairman-ceo-at-capitol-records-group.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tom March Named Chairman &amp;amp; CEO At Capitol Records Group</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./james-corden-s-wife-julia-carey-showcases-incredible-physique-chic-scalloped-swimsuit-enjoy-barbados-sun-festive-family-jaunt-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>James Corden's wife Julia Carey showcases her incredible physique in Barbados</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
