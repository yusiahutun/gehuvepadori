"Scheana and I literally made out for two seconds in her kitchen, and you would think that I got on one knee and gave her like a six-carat ring," he later told the camera. "We're friends! I almost have to hold a dictionary up to her and let her know what friend means."</p><p>Meanwhile, Scheana was more concerned with making Dayna's first day at SUR absolutely miserable because Dayna's after Max, who briefly dated Scheana and called her "boy crazy" <strong><a href=#>last week</a></strong>.</p><p>"Before yesterday, I only knew Dayna as the girl who I would literally walk right past to get into my friends' bar," Scheana told the camera. "Now, she's the girl who's not only f--king her boss but my leftovers. Is it really Dayna's job to polish every glass on the patio? No. It happens to the best of us. It happened to me.

Pretty standard scenario for SUR.</p><p>Danica called Max the "most thirstiest person I've ever met in my entire life" and told Scheana and Ariana that he had sex with two friends she brought to TomTom for a birthday dinner. "Different times! Different times," she clarified. "[He] told them that he owned a little bit of part of TomTom, so I hope [Dayna] doesn't feel like she's special or irreplaceable." According to Scheana, "she definitely does."</p><p>Meanwhile, Max told Dayna the reason he stopped his month-long fling with Scheana was because he realized they were in very different places in their lives. He said she told him she stopped taking birth control and was freezing her eggs.</p><p>"With Dayna, there's a lot of depth to her," he later told the camera. "And with Scheana, we talk about photo shoots she was going to or her music or emojis or something, I don't know. It wasn't enlightening to me."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:64132633-aa4c-5ac5-a8a1-80ae58e4547b data-container-ref=toofab:article:ab066eef-6bb0-580f-ab29-762a01e6e2ea data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c2/5by4/2020/01/07/c28886d3af45533c9ba467b7c7ab01e7_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Vanderpump Rules Recap: Kristen Confronts 'F--king Bitch' Lala on Season 8 Premiere</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>While talking about Brittany and Jax's joint bachelor-bachelorette party in Miami, Kristen and Katie made up. The girls also told Kristen they felt the trip would be a good break away from Carter, who got into it with Lala last week over his alleged refusal to move out of Kristen's apartment or pay for anything. Jax later told Brittany he saw right through the whole situation. "You don't sleep together, and he's mean to you!" he said. "What are you getting out of this relationship?"</p><p>"Carter actually has a pretty good scam going on here," he later told the camera. "I mean, Kristen really pays for everything. He doesn't want Kristen going to Miami without him! I mean, the girls are gonna chirp in her ear the whole time."</p><p>Back at SUR, Scheana kept making flirty comments to Brett. "Scheana just comes on a little bit too strong," he told the camera. "I always saw it as just us being friends, but she wants to find Mr. Right, and that's not me." He decided to pull her aside and make sure she knew he wanted to be platonic.</p><p>"You're saying that," she later told the camera. "I don't know if I believe you. You literally kissed me the first night we hung out, so obviously, you felt something."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3cde885e-dfff-558d-a48f-fe8d3ad641b1 data-container-ref=toofab:article:ab066eef-6bb0-580f-ab29-762a01e6e2ea data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ed/5by4/2020/01/06/ed290d96990250dd91cc8b5b746617de_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">YouTube/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Lisa Vanderpump Talks Stassi-Kristen Fallout, Jax Taylor's Drama with Vanderpump Rules Cast</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Elsewhere, Ariana asked if she could meet with Lisa. She wanted her job back at SUR because she didn't like sitting at home and waiting for her cocktail book to come out.</p><p>"I don't understand, because when somebody you've employed for 10 years starts talking a lot of shit about you, quite frankly, I'm kind of mystified as to why you would want to come back here," Lisa told Ariana, referring to the comments she made last season about how she didn't like the way Lisa was handling business with the Toms.</p><p>But Lisa maintained, "The greatest compliment I could ever give your boyfriend is to ask him if he would like to be involved in our business. My feelings were really hurt." Ariana apologized and said she wanted to repair their relationship, and Lisa seemed to be on the same page. However, that didn't automatically mean Ariana could come back to SUR -- at least not yet.</p><p>The two got to talking, and Ariana revealed she was actually surprisingly a bit sad now that she had the house and the book. Lisa seemed to think that meant Ariana was unhappy with herself, and she didn't disagree. "I think I need to be medicated," she told Lisa, who asked if she was depressed. Ariana later told the camera she felt there would never come a time when she didn't experience that underlying feeling.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:568f35ec-b9f7-52a3-aa09-993876e673c0 data-container-ref=toofab:article:ab066eef-6bb0-580f-ab29-762a01e6e2ea data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/70/5by4/2019/12/13/70f9f19dd6215a06aad179fed1a711fb_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kyle Richards Claps Back After Lisa Vanderpump's Christmas Gift Dig (Exclusive Video)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Later, Jax and Katie went over to Kristen's to help her finish packing up her boxes to move into her new house. Carter called, and according to Katie, he did not sound like an ex-boyfriend. He was using the pronoun "we" while discussing the new house.</p><p>Jax simply couldn't take it and told Kristen the only reason Carter was being so nice was because he needed a place to live. She assured him Carter was not moving into the new place but that he was hoping she was going to change her mind.</p><p>When Jax brought up the Miami trip, Kristen said she didn't want to be responsible for deciding whether or not Carter came. That's when Jax asked if they were together.</p><p>"We are not dating," Kristen maintained. Jax responded, "So when he gets here, I'm gonna tell him that he can't come. Is that okay?" Kristen simply said, "Good luck."</p><p>Jax then went on to make some unsolicited comments about how Kristen was vulnerable and Carter was taking advantage of her. "Why buy the cow when you get the milk for free?" Kristen was not having it.</p><p>"Maybe he's sad because he loves me and it sucks that our family is getting torn apart?" Kristen said, starting to choke up. Jax fired back, "Why can't he just pay his bills then?! That's all he has to do! It's simple. Get a job. Everybody has to get a job. Uber! Uber's hiring. Lyft is always hiring."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:07dec7d7-9d8e-5016-96cf-4296819a101a data-container-ref=toofab:article:ab066eef-6bb0-580f-ab29-762a01e6e2ea data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/13/5by4/2019/11/26/137e56b5950557dc8093a853fdab43b8_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Billie Lee Details Terrifying Night Involving 'Sex Trafficking,' Aggressive Men and a Fake Lyft Driver</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>When Carter arrived, Jax took him to another room to chat away from the girls. He urged Carter to go on a month-long break from Kristen, but Carter didn't seem to think that was a good idea.</p><p>"Don't you think that's a decision that she needs to make?" Carter asked. Jax said Carter needed to make it since Kristen couldn't, but Carter explained, "That's not what I want."</p><p>"The other day, I texted her. I'm like, 'When I leave, who's gonna be there?'" he told Jax. "I want her to know that this is what's going to happen because I am always the one that she calls when shit's f--ked up. I'm not trying to guilt her. I'm not guilting her! I want her to realize I'm not gonna be around."</p><p>Jax later called it "some manipulative shit right there," and told Carter point-blank that he couldn't come to Miami because Kristen said they weren't together. Carter took the news surprisingly well.</p><p>"Vanderpump Rules" airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. on Bravo.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
