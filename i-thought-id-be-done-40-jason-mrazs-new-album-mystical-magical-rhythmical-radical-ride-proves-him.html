I thought I’d be done [with music] by then and the ideal life would be a family, kids and moving on.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When you turn 40, it’s exciting. I celebrated my 40th birthday performing at the Hollywood Bowl.

In the same song, he also ponders what might happen “if I reach 65”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Getting Started”, “I Feel Like Dancing” and “Feel Good Too” – the album’s opening three numbers – sound like energetic odes to dancing the night away with youthful joy, if not outright abandon.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mraz pauses for thought when asked if he has undergone a midlife crisis.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I don’t think I’ve had a midlife crisis just yet,” he replies. “But maybe I have – and I haven’t lived long enough past it to see that: ‘Oh, yeah, that was definitely a midlife crisis.’</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I have absolutely shaken things up, over and over, for myself. I can see that pattern reappearing throughout my life. And every time I do, I rediscover myself through the power of songwriting.

Wisdom can be gained from experience. But for a veteran artist who has been in the public eye for more than 20 years as music trends constantly change, feeling secure about your position can be challenging.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The older I get, certain worries and stresses just sort of fade away,” Mraz says. “I don’t stress as much about how I look or surface-level things, like fashion. As a young person, I cared about: ‘Do I fit in? How do I look?’ There was a lot of vanity in my youth.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The cons, as you get older, are that I’m not really in the youth category any more. Here I am, making a pop album and dance album. In music, those categories are dominated by young people, 18 to 28, and always have been.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“So, there’s this feeling of: ‘I’m not really in the little kid category any more – or the older group. I’m floating in the middle.’”</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">How would I rate my dancing? Right now, about 3 out of 10. But I want to be betterJason Mraz</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Middle age is not the only factor that inspired Mraz to write and record new songs specifically designed to encourage him – and his listeners – to party down and shake their collective booty.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He also credits his mother, June Tomes, for encouraging him to make an overtly pop-oriented album. Mraz wasn’t getting any younger, she noted, so he should do a pop album “before it’s too late”. He concurs. The liner notes for Mystical Magical Rhythmical Radical Ride dedicate the album to “Mama June”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/05/7b23dea0-baae-47eb-83c1-ea7db2c30ccf_d532e003.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Speaking recently from his farm home in Oceanside, in southern California, Mraz – who married Christina Carano in 2015 and recently announced their divorce – stresses that he specifically sought to make a pop album that embraced old-school music values.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I always really wanted to make a dance-pop album, but not an electronic [dance] album that leaned on computer programs and drum machines,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I wanted to make human dance music. So, sonically, that’s what our effort was. And thematically, I noticed that what was missing from my shows – year after year – was that I didn’t have enough uptempo songs that could turn the show into a dance party for my audience and myself.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“How would I rate my dancing? Right now, about 3 out of 10. But I want to be better. And that’s how a song like ‘I Feel Like Dancing’ finds its way through my subconscious and lands on the page. Because I try to generate experiences I haven’t had yet, or want to have, and songs can help.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/05/99aa5f32-54d2-438e-9906-23659a56c881_ba57e545.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For at least half the selections on Mystical Magical Rhythmical Radical Ride – whose title comes from the lyrics to “Disco Sun”, a song on the album – Mraz takes a deep dive into the music of the 1970s and early 1980s.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mraz’s new album reunites him with Sweden’s Martin Terefe, whose recording production credits range from Train and Mary J. Blige to Yungblud and Coldplay.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Terefe produced Mraz’s 2008 album, We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things, which includes two of Mraz’s biggest hits – “I’m Yours” and “Lucky” (the latter featuring Colbie Caillat) – and remains his biggest-selling release, with sales of nearly 5 million.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mraz has made five albums since then – including 2020’s reggae-inspired “Look for the Good” – and his sensitive singer-songwriter persona has remained intact.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is the first album since We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things that feels the most like a sequel to that album, more so than anything I’ve made since then, because of how…” His voice trails off.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I don’t know,” he says a moment later. “I don’t know what to tell you. I’m just happy this album is out. It feels new and yet familiar, like something I would have done in 2008 but it happens to be in 2023.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/05/4593d7a2-310a-4606-ac8e-bc420957179e_9addea10.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The fact that he has released three albums since turning 40 suggests Mraz’s career should extend beyond middle age.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He performed May 6 at San Diego’s Snapdragon Stadium, in the US state of California, on a double-bill with Jimmy Buffett and will be on tour for much of the summer with the group Mraz bills as his Superband. Their itinerary includes a July 22 concert at Fivepoint Amphitheatre in Irvine, also in California.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I was really surprised to get to my 40s and still be generating songs and ideas, and to be diving deeper. I kind of woke up one day and realised this is what my life would be,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I had the pleasure of sitting with Willie Nelson four or five years ago – when he was 85 – in Maui. It was just the two of us and all he wanted to do was play demos for me! He was like: ‘Hey, want to hear a new song I wrote?’ He played one CD after another of his new songs for me, and he was 85 or 86 at the time! He’s 90 now, still recording and touring.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Taylor Swift to only play Singapore in Southeast Asia.

Why would we ever consider retirement, or think our ideas would dry up?’</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“That was really inspiring. It made me realise that I’ll probably do this my whole life. The playing field may change – musical trends, who my colleagues are, or what the perceptions of me are – all those things will be in flux.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But I can rest assured knowing I’ll wake up every day with interesting new music ideas, or a new idea accident that will happen on my instrument that will lead to a new song.
