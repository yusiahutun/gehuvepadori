It's the tightest curl type out there —&nbsp;and is often categorized as the most difficult to look after. Although our hair type is complex, when you're armed with proper knowledge and products, caring for 4C strands doesn't have to feel like a chore.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The complexity and fluidity of 4C curls are as unique as a fingerprint," says Robin Groover, chief hair officer at beauty tech company Myavana. "Caring for 4C hair requires attention to its unique characteristics and a commitment to maintaining moisture and promoting overall hair health."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To help you curate and optimize your 4C hair-care routine, we've tapped Groover and other textured hair experts for their tips and product recommendations.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-4c-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What is 4C hair?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"4C curls refer to a specific <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>curl pattern</a> in natural hair texture, particularly in the context of the hair typing system developed by Andre Walker," says Groover. "This system categorizes hair into different types based on curl pattern and texture. The 4C category is characterized by tightly coiled or kinky curls."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The hair type has a ziz-zag, Z-shape instead of the C-shape of other curls. "4C hair is more commonly found in people of African descent, including those with ancestry from sub-Saharan Africa," says Groover. However, research from Myavana, which uses consumer-sent <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>hair samples to identify hair type and offer care recommendations</a>, indicates that many of those who self-diagnose their hair as 4C don't actually have 4C hair. Hairstylist Todd Edwards echoes this sentiment. "Clients tend to think that if they have a lot of shrinkage, they have 4C hair, which is not always the case," says Edwards, who is also a Mizani artist.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-key-characteristics-of-4c-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Key Characteristics of 4C Hair</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Tight Colis</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"4C hair has tight, small coils ranging from pencil-sized to much smaller," says Groover. "The curls may form a zig-zag pattern or a tight spiral." It's important to note that different curl types may mimic a 4C curl when dehydrated. "The needs of authentic tight coils and dehydrated tight coils are totally different," Groover adds.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Natural Volume</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is my favorite part of having 4C hair. "4C hair tends to have a lot of natural volume, which can be a desirable feature for those who love voluminous hairstyles," says Groover.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Shrinkage</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When your curls are super tight, your strands appear much shorter than they actually are. "Shrinkage is a sign of healthy hair," says celebrity hairstylist Ursula Stephen. "It’s a sign that your hair hasn’t lost its elasticity. This is exactly what 4C hair is supposed to do when it hasn’t been compromised by heat damage."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Versatility</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Despite common misconceptions, 4C hair is quite versatile," says Groover. Stephen, who works with Carol's Daughter, adds: "This hair can be manipulated into whatever curl patterns and shapes you desire," says Stephen. When heat-styled sparingly and with care, it holds onto straight looks while lending its natural volume to the look.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Parched & Prone to Dryness</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Because 4C strands grow out vertically, the sebum from the sebaceous glands are not able to travel down the hair strand to lubricate the hair, giving the hair a dried-out feel," says Edwards. Groover notes that "adequate moisturizing and hydration are crucial for maintaining healthy 4C hair."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Style Longevity</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Because this hair type tends to be dryer and coarse, you don't have to worry about scalp oils ruining a style. With proper care, you can stretch a twist out or a silk press for over a week. "This hair can hold hairstyles for a long time," says Stephen.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-care-for-4c-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Care for 4C Hair</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Manually Distribute Natural Oils</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The tight coil pattern of 4C hair makes it more challenging for natural oils produced by the scalp to travel down the hair shaft," says Groover. "As a result, the hair is less lubricated, leading to dryness. This characteristic makes it important for individuals with 4C hair to manually distribute oils through techniques such as finger detangling or using a wide-tooth comb."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Regularly Clarify</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Because 4C hair is naturally dry, it's common to reach for super thick products. Some of these have molecular weights that are too large to penetrate the shaft, leading to build-up. This build-up can render your nourishing routine superfluous, as nutrients, moisturizers, and hydrators will just sit on top of hair instead of doing their job within.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When you detox your hair of product buildup, Grooer notes, you can see a big change in its appearance, moisture retention, and manageability. So it's essential to use a shampoo that removes buildup without stripping moisture. She recommends the Bumble and bumble<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow> Sunday Shampoo</a> ($34). Other great options are the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Briogeo Scalp Revival Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo</a> ($42) and the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Color Wow Color Security Shampoo</a> ($24).</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Focus on Intentional Conditioning</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"4C hair may have high porosity, meaning that the hair cuticles have openings or gaps that allow moisture to escape easily," says Groover. "This can result in difficulty retaining moisture, leading to dryness. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Deep conditioning treatments</a> and leave-in conditioners can help improve moisture retention."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For leave-ins, Stephen loves the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Hydrating Leave-In Conditioner</a> ($12). "It really helps to moisturize dry and brittle hair, making it manageable and ready to style," she says. Edwards recommends the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Mizani Miracle Milk Cream</a> ($26). He says "it’s an amazing leave-in conditioner, heat protectant, and detangler — my must-have." For deep conditioning, Robin recommends the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Hair Mask</a> ($11). The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>Pureology Hydrate Nourishing Superfoods Treatment Hair Mask</a> ($44) also works wonders.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Get Regular Trims</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Regular trims help prevent split ends and breakage," says Groover. "It's important to keep the ends healthy to support overall hair growth."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Prioritize Strengthening Products</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Our research indicates that combination therapy of strengthening and hydrating treatments provide balance for retention," says Groover. So incorporating bond-builders and protein-rich products (like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>those with rice water</a>) is key. For days when I don't have time to do a moisture and protein mask, I reach for the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Olaplex No.3 and No.0 Duo</a> ($60). No. 0 primes the hair for No. 3, a pre-shampoo moisture treatment. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Briogeo Rice Protein + Algae Rich Rice Water Shampoo Concentrate</a> ($42) and <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength Shampoo</a> ($10) are great strengthening cleansers. For an intensive treatment, try the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel=nofollow>Cécred Fermented Rice and Rose Protein Ritual</a> ($52). It's so strong it should be used no more than once every three months.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Practice Nighttime Protection</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Use a satin or silk scarf, bonnet, or sleep on a satin or silk pillowcase to reduce friction and prevent moisture loss while sleeping," says Groover.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Treat Hair With Steam Therapy</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Because the cuticle, the outermost layer of the hair shaft, is often compact in 4C hair, it is "more difficult for moisture to penetrate the hair shaft, contributing to dryness," says Groover. "Steam therapy builds hydration from the inside out with short and long-term benefits."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You can go to a salon for a professional steam treatment or do one at home. Snag a <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>hair steamer hood</a> ($80) for the full effect, or fake it by putting on a <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>reusable conditioning cap</a> ($6) over a deep conditioning treatment. Then, take a hot bath or do a sweaty workout to build up body heat and create steam within the cap.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Seal in Moisture</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"After applying a leave-in conditioner or moisturizer, seal in the moisture with natural oils such as jojoba, olive, or coconut oil," says Groover. "This helps to lock in hydration and reduce moisture loss." the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Bread Beauty Supply Everday Gloss</a> ($24), <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Verb Ghost Weightless Hair Oil</a> ($34), and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Cécred Nourishing Hair Oil</a> ($44) are among my faves.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Style With Care</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whatever products you use to style your hair should make your hair both look and feel good. For wet styling like twist-outs and wash-and-gos, Groover recommends the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Design Essentials Almond & Avocado Curl Enhancing Mousse</a> ($17) while Edwards suggests the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Mizani True Textures Perfect Coil Oil Gel</a> ($26). For heat styling, I love the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Pattern Heat Protectant</a> ($20). "Because of how easy it is to damage 4C hair, you should always be using some type of heat protection," says Edwards.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57k5xknK2iocBuhJRuaGtpZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wanted-have-you-seen-these-fugitives-10.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wanted: Have you seen these fugitives?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./monica-beets-wedding-age-husband-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Beautiful Monica Beets Wedding, Meet Husband - Who She Married?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pepsi-nutrition-facts.html>15 Fizzy Pepsi Nutrition Facts To Quench Your Curiosity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./skin-tightening-face-pack-1228408.html>6 Wonderful Skin Tightening Face Packs for Flawless Skin</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-are-shellac-nails.html>Shellac Nails Promise Gel Results with Less Damage</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./stephen-huszar-movies.html>Stephen Huszar Movies: His 10 Best Hallmark Romances, Ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./why-margot-robbie-mortified-barbie-shoot-attention.html>Why Margot Robbie Was 'Mortified' By the Attention 'Barbie' Shoot Generated</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncVibe.
